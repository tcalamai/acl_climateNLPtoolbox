His colleagues at CRU (Climategate central headquarters) have recently been shown hiding data from reconstructions, blocking skeptical papers which demonstrate the problems in paleo math, and removing points from temperature curves to hide downtrends. We know that only a single very high warming station is being used in GHCN for the Antarctic. We know that Switzerland and Austrailia have some very unusual warming trends.
