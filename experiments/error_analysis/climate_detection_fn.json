The rate relief was requested to defer significant distribution rate increases which would be passed onto end use customers due to the formulaic approach of rate calculations under the AUC PBR mechanism. Electricity Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution cited the current economic situation in Alberta, including the hardships faced by some end use customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as rationale to proceed with these interim rates. Electricity Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution are to file an application by March 1, 2021, outlining the duration of the rate freeze and collection timelines, expected deferral values including carrying costs and anticipated impacts to customers.",

They also include one-time gains and losses, significant impairments, restructuring charges and other items that are not in the normal course of business or a result of day-to-day operations recorded at various times over the past eight quarters. These items are excluded from adjusted earnings and are highlighted below: * In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, Canadian Utilities closed a series of transactions related to the sale of its Canadian fossil fuel-based electricity generation business and Alberta PowerLine resulting in a gain on sale of operations of $125 million after-tax. As these transactions are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings. * In the second quarter of 2020, impairment and other costs not in the normal course of business of $30 million after-tax were recorded. These costs mainly relate to certain assets that no longer represent strategic value to the Company. As these costs are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings. * In the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company signed a Master Services Agreement with IBM Canada Ltd. (IBM) to provide managed information technology services. These services are currently provided by Wipro under a ten-year MSA maturing in December 2024. The Company has recognized costs of $55 million after-tax, which represents management's best estimate of the costs to exit the Wipro MSA. The actual costs are expected to be finalized later in 2021. As these costs are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings.",
