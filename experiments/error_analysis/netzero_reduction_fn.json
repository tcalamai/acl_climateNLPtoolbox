        "text": "\"South Sudan, through this second NDC, reiterates its commitment to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, while making efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees celsius. It details how South Sudan has significantly increases its climate ambition of reducing emissions across its sectors by 109.87 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent while sequestering an additional 45.06 million tonnes by 2030\"\n\"South Sudan will continue to focus on increasing the share of renewable energy in the total energy mix. By increasing the share of solar, wind, hydro and biomass, South Sudan aims at achieving cumulative emission reduction of 69 percent by 2030 compared to the baseline. South Sudan will also promote the use of energy-efficient technologies and decentralized renewable energy grids, which can be both time- and cost-effective, to increase electricity access in rural areas\"\nAlong with the negative impacts of long-term conflicts, the adverse effects of changing climate are also being faced by the inhabitants of South Sudan. The country is experiencing an increasingly warm and dry climate with erratic rainfall. This is resulting in degradation of ecosystems and decreased agricultural productivity that is negatively impacting the livelihoods of a majority of the population. Political and economic instability, including limited access to capital, markets, infrastructure and technology, along with changing climate, are hindering the growth of the country.\nRecognizing this, and to achieve sustainable economic development, South Sudan aims to transition from a least developed country to a middle-income country by 2030, supported by inclusive, stable and sustainable economic growth, while alleviating poverty. Promoting environmental sustainability, climate-resilient communities and appropriate land use has been identified as a critical enabler that will complement the eight strategic priorities of the National Development Strategy (NDS) 2018-2021 (South Sudan Ministry of Finance and Planning 2018)",

        "text": "The energy sector is the highest contributor of GHG in Liberia emanating mainly from the use of traditional fuels such as firewood, charcoal and palm oil and the use of fossil fuels,\nespecially petroleum products. To reduce the reliance on traditional fuel and increase the use of modern and renewable energy sources, the National Energy Policy (2009) was\ndeveloped with a set of goals targeted at maximizing efficiency, minimizing costs and adverse environmental impacts as principle of extending energy access to all Liberians.\nMost recently, Liberia's Initial National Communication (2013) reinforces the National Energy Policy with additional long-term targets and related activities, which includes:\n* Reducing GHGs by at least 10% by 2030\n* Improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2030\n* Raising share of renewable energy to at least 30% of electricity production and\n10% of overall energy consumption by 2030\n* Replacing cooking stoves with low thermal efficiency (5-10%) with the higherefficiency (40%) stoves.\nThe long-term strategy of Liberia is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The strategic\noptions for mitigation considered under the INDC are the energy sector (electricity,\ntransport) and the waste sector. The Waste Sector focuses on solid waste disposal on land.\nIn 2000, the waste sector accounted for about 0.60% of Liberia's national total CO2 eq\nemissions. A significant subcategory is CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites\n(SWDS) on land, which contributed 91.7%. CH4 mitigation targets will include landfill\nrecovery, waste incineration with energy recovery, composting of organic waste,\ncontrolled wastewater treatment, and recycling and waste minimization.",
