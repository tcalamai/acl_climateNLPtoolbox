        "text":"Climate Change From wildfires to flooding to extreme heat events and droughts, the impacts of climate-related weather events were felt around the world in 2021. Calls for action on climate change continued to grow, with the World Economic Forum's 2021 Global Risks Report identifying climate action failure as the most impactful long-term risk facing the world' Further, the sixth assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) signals that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying, and predicts that, without drastic action, average global warming of 1.5degC will be reached before 20402 The International Energy Agency's Net Zero by 2050 report shows that the pathway to achieving anet-zero emissions energy grid is narrow but still achievable, requiring rapid deployment of clean energy technologies:deg The metals and minerals that the mining industry produces are essential to these clean energy and decarbonization technologies, and therefore are a key part of the global transition to a low- carbon economy. For example, global copper demand for alternative energy sources is expected to jump from 2.1 million tonnes in 2020 to 4.3 million tonnes in 2030.\" In 2021, many companies in the mining industry recognized this opportunity to not only contribute to clean technologies, but to also use these technologies to reduce their own emissions, and renewed their commitments and action towards decarbonizing their production processes. In early 2022, we updated our climate strategy and goals. Our long-term strategic priority to achieve net-zero emissions at our operations by 2050 now includes a goal that focuses on achieving net-zero Scope 2 emissions by 2025, replacing our goal of achieving 100% clean GRI Indicators and Topic Boundary 201-2, 302-103, 302-1, 302-3, 302-4, 305-103, 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5 This topic is considered one of the most material by our shareholders, local communities, regulators and society in relation to Teck's sites, power providers, service providers and customers. electricity in Chile by 2030. In addition, we announced our ambition to achieve net-zero Scope 3 emissions by 2050 with supporting short-term goals.\" In 2021, we continued to work towards our goals, and made progress in several areas, including advancing our Carbon- Reduction Technology Roadmap, which will guide the creation of site-level net-zero plans. We also released our TCFD-aligned Climate Change Outlook 2021 Report to share our detailed approach to, and management of, climate change risks and opportunities. Teck sites continued to experience the physical impacts of climate change through the past year. The record 2021 British Columbia wildfire season resulted in temporary impacts at our Highland Valley Copper and Trail operations. In the fall and winter seasons, heavy rain, flooding and mudslides disrupted the rail service between our steelmaking coal operations and west coast terminals.\" We are taking into account the increased frequency of extreme weather events and working to incorporate climate change scenarios and vulnerability assessments into project design and evaluation, as well as at our existing operations.

It said the proposed mandatory code of conduct would \"address systemic issues within the wholesale gas market and guide participants' behaviour\". The proposal includes compulsory mediation and arbitration in disputes between producers and consumers, allows for supply to be forced into the market and penalty provisions that some in the industry are describing as \"extraordinary\". Consultation on a draft bill that allows for the price caps and market reforms closes on December 13, just three days after it was released. Consultation on the price cap specifically closes on December 15, while consultation on the rest of the proposed policy closes on February 7. Mr Samter said it was beyond him why any major player in the east coast market would put fresh capital into gas supply, given the huge uncertainty in the regulatory regime now. \"For all the headlines and quotes [on Friday] that this is a temporary measure, this embarrassing draft bill is then planning to implement a mandatory code of conduct where they have basically nationalised the gas market, but expect private entities to keep putting their capital into it,\" Mr Samter told clients. He said the system would mean upstream gas was treated like infrastructure, limiting returns, despite the risks involved. \"I mean, seriously, have you ever heard anything more ridiculous in your life?\" He questioned how \"anyone could form a strong view on how this all plays out to say spend $15 billion on buying Origin\", casting doubt on the takeover proposal for the major energy supplier from Brookfield and EIG Group that is currently in the due diligence phase.

        "text":"39 | Ford Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report 2022 Contents Ford Fundamentals Our Sustainability Strategy Driving Innovation and Sustainable Growth Putting People First Protecting the Environment Creating Responsible and Ethical Growth Risks The most significant risk factors applicable to our business are outlined below. Operational Risks Ford+: Our long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+, our plan for growth and value creation. Ford+ is focused on delivering distinctive and increasingly electric products plus always-on customer relationships and user experiences. Climate Change: The risks and opportunities associated with climate change shape the way we do business, including our global carbon reduction strategy focused on reducing emissions from our vehicles, operations, and supply chain. Extreme weather events such as storms or floods can disrupt production or component supplies, while droughts can affect our access to water for our operations, especially in water-scarce areas. Public Health Issues: Our financial condition and results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by public health issues, including the health impacts of climate change and epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19, including changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears, and market downturns, and restrictions on business and individual activities, has periodically created significant volatility in the global economy. Safety Recalls: Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns. Our vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs. Reliance on Suppliers: We depend on our complex global supply chain to deliver components for our vehicles. Our products contain components sourced from suppliers that, in turn, source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components, such as the semiconductor shortage, can disrupt the production of vehicles. Cybersecurity Risks: As we develop and produce vehicles with increased connectivity, operating, and security systems are more at risk from potential disruptions. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices to process, transmit, and store vital data. Despite data privacy and security measures, we are at risk of outages, cyberattacks, security breaches, or natural events, all of which could impact operational systems, compromise sensitive or personal information, or negatively affect the performance and safety of our vehicles. Workforce Stability: Our ongoing success depends on our ability to continue to recruit and retain a talented and diverse workforce that is highly skilled in engineering, software, technology, and other areas. Global competition for such talent is intense, with potential employees increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, and the loss of existing employees or an inability to recruit new employees could have an adverse effect on our business. Changes needing us to accelerate our ability to reskill, upskill and better develop our employees to complete our transformation to electrification also contributes to risk. Macroeconomic, Market and Strategic Risks Market Competition: Our products and services are subject to market acceptance as well as competition from other players in the automotive, mobility, and digital services industries. Although we conduct extensive market research before launching a vehicle or service, many factors within and outside our control can affect their success. For example, a shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable ICE vehicles, due to rising fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, or government actions or incentives, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations in the near term. Geopolitics: With our global footprint and the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy, a geopolitical crisis or changes to\/withdrawals from existing trade agreements could have an immediate and material impact on our results. The U.S. government has considered applying tariffs on automobiles, parts, and other materials that could disrupt existing supply chains, impose additional costs on our business, affect demand for our products, and make Ford less competitive. Financial Risks Market Disruption: Our business is susceptible to credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, and regulatory requirements, which may impact our ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost. Moreover, if these events occur, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints. Government Incentives: We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments around the world in the form of grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. These incentives encourage manufacturers to establish or increase investment, workforce, and\/or production. A decrease, expiration, or clawback of such incentives could impact our financial condition significantly. Credit: Ford Credit could experience higher credit losses, lower residual values, or higher return volumes for leased vehicles than expected. Credit risk (the possibility of loss from a customer's or dealer's failure to make payments according to contract terms) is heavily dependent upon economic factors such as unemployment, consumer debt service burden, personal income growth, and used car prices. Pension and Other Post-retirement Plans: The measurement of our obligations, costs, and liabilities associated with benefits related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans requires us to use assumptions to estimate the present value of projected future payments to all participants. If actual results are less favorable than our assumptions, we may recognize a substantial remeasurement loss in our results. In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources were insufficient to meet our post-retirement obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, suspend dividend payments, or seek additional capital.",

        "text":"MESSAGE FROM CHAIRMAN The Qantas Group has always shown leadership on issues important to Australia, and climate change is no different. For over a decade, we've been building one of the world's largest offsetting programs for customers, and we're driving the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia. As we emerge from the pandemic, we're also focused on protecting the future of travel by continuing to value the planet, enabling our people and connecting our customers and communities. We are committed to creating a stronger, more agile Qantas Group that can sustainably deliver value to our customers, people, and shareholders. This includes managing the risks and seizing the opportunities that climate action provides. The Qantas Group's Climate Action Plan outlines our interim targets and initiatives to hit net zero emissions. Our ambition is to reduce net emissions by 25 per cent by 2030 and increase our uptake of sustainable aviation fuel by 10 per cent by 2030. This will be complemented by an average 1.5 per cent per annum efficiency target, driving a reduction in fuel burn through fleet modernisation and operational efficiencies in the air and on the ground. We are also targeting zero single-use plastics across our operations by 2027 and zero waste to landfill by 2030. It's exciting to see technological advances overseas, particularly in the development of sustainable aviation fuel. Australia already produces significant amounts of feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel but exports it to other countries. In the future these feedstocks could be used to build a domestic industry, creating jobs and fuel security here in Australia. It is not just a huge opportunity; it is the right thing to do. Achieving net zero emissions targets will not be easy, and it will take sustained and cooperative action by everyone at the Qantas Group as well as the entire global aviation value chain, governments and investors. Supportive government policy is critical for the aviation industry to transition to low and zero-emissions technologies. Understanding sustainability and the impacts of climate change, promoting long-term value creation, and articulating our approach to our stakeholders, is not optional. It's built into how we do business. We look forward to updating you on our progress. RICHARD GOYDER Chairman QANTAS GROUP CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 3",

Good morning. I have two questions if I may. I'm sure we'll come back to the price card and volume decision and all that, but since I was [Indiscernible] question it, I just would like to have an update on Syria if there is any news on your discussion ongoing with the DOJ. And second, I'd like to ask about your growth ambition in India because we've seen that ACC in Abuja in their call last week have planned to take capacities for each of the companies to 50 million tons in the next two years versus like 30ish million to respectively. So that implies 35 million tons capacity addition over the next three years, which is really big. I was a bit surprised by that. So if you could comment on your ambition in India. Thank you very much. Jan Jenisch Thank you, Elodie. And good morning to you. I start with the second question and then I think Geraldine can complete your first question. Yes.

I think in India the forecast is that cementitious products will double over the next 12 years or so, and we are as the number two player in a good position here too. To take also advantage so we have now the first two new plants commissioned, and we will plan the next steps here, how to participate in this market growth. Geraldine Picaud Yes, Elodie. So about your question on Syria. Of course, as you know, this is a legacy issue related to the alleged contract of the Lafarge subsidiary in Syria prior to Holcim's merger with Lafarge in 2015. Of course, the alleged conduct as you know, is in stark contrast with everything that Holcim stands for. Look, we are as disclosed in the annual report, discussions continue with DOJ concerning a potential resolution. But at this stage, as we speak, we cannot make an assessment as to the timing or as to the outcome of those discussions, we don't have any further comment. Elodie Rall Thanks very much. Operator The next question comes from the line of Lars Kjellberg with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.",

Their nutrient efficiency platform has the potential to reduce nitrogen fertilizer application by up to 50 lbs per acre (almost 75 kg per hectare). Leaps has also invested in Joyn Bio , a joint venture between Bayer and Gingko which aimed to significantly reduce the environmental impact of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers through a technology that fixes nitrogen in the soil . Moreover, Leaps is invested in California-based company Andes , which is reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers through its novel seed treatment called 'Microprime', a technology that enables the crop to draw down nitrogen from the air instead of relying on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. By fully exploiting these technologies, I am convinced we can reduce 30 percent of global nitrogen fertilizer use. This would be equivalent to removing 200 million cars from the road - surely a goal worth pursuing. 4. Food loss and food waste According to the IPCC report, the mitigation options for food loss and food waste are also comparatively low. Again, I am a bit cautious about not underestimating this potential. The FAO estimates that about 1.3 billion tons of food are lost or wasted globally every year. While food waste in our own households - which could be easily avoided by more conscious shopping behavior - is one part of the problem, the more essential aspect of food loss is that quite a lot of food never even reaches our shelves. On average, about one third of fruit and vegetables are lost during production or transport. Extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, are becoming more frequent and regularly destroy crops. Such land loss is also food loss. Moreover, plant pests and diseases threaten harvests. From an environmental point of view, 8 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to result from Home My Network Job",
