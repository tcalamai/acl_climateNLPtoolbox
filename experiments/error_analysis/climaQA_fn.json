Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products. The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gasengines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.",

We also recognize that with increasing public and investor concerns over climate change, a lack of disclosure on how we identify and manage climate change risks could expose us to potential reputational risk. For example, over the past few years, there has been an increase in investor interest on environmental, social and governance factors, which includes responding to and mitigating climate risks. As a result, we have been strengthening the transparency and credibility of the information we publish publicly on climate-related issues, including concerning governance, risks, opportunities and performance.

There is increased interest in companies' sustainability performance and their action to mitigate environmental impacts. We have scientists working to discover new medicines that will help solve our world's greatest health challenges. This is particularly important as the impacts of climate change are threatening to affect the global spread and occurrence of infectious diseases. Lilly reinvests nearly a quarter of our revenue into research and development (R and D), one of the highest rates across all industries. These investments have allowed us to launch 10 new medicines in the last five years - including one in 2018 - and have up to 10 additional potential launches by 2023. We translated our R and D progress into strong business results in 2018. Lilly's revenue rose 7%, driven by our recently launched products. We explore innovations that can lessen the total negative environmental outputs which can result from production of a medicine. We support these through implementing green chemistry principles in R and D and end-product engineering, and by reducing the carbon footprint of our value chain and operations through our Product Stewardship Standard and Global Engineering Requirements. Some of our efforts include evaluating and incorporating alternative energy sources, new technologies, and best practices for energy use and GHG emission reductions; and implementing new manufacturing technologies which minimize environmental impact, such as continuous flow processes, which we have advanced in the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, we identified promoting cogeneration as an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions in our operations. This uses combustion to generate electricity on-site while also recovering usable heat. In 2018, we progressed the design and construction for a 9 megawatt combined heat and power system at our Puerto Rico facility (expected 2020 completion) resulting in anticipated energy savings of $6 to $7 million annually and approximately 15% reduction in site GHG emissions. We also operate combined heat and power systems in Ireland, Italy, England and Indiana.",
