SSAB will, as part of Business Sweden's delegation, raise the need for enabling regulatory frameworks and a level playing eld as well as highlight the importance of partnerships and cross-sector co- operation to reach Paris Agreement targets. The steel industry accounts for about 7% of emissions globally. It is evident that new technologies, such as HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology), can deliver substantial emission cuts but the transition needs to be accelerated as shown by the latest report from UN Climate Change. (Climate Plans Remain Insucient: More Ambitious Action Needed Now | UNFCCC ). The green transformation also requires a societal change that needs to be underpinned by enabling regulatory frameworks, large investments and cooperation along value chains and between private and public sectors. Global carbon pricing mechanisms and standards that put a quality stamp on near-zero emission materials can play an important role in reaching climate targets.",

The roadmap is based on decarbonisation trajectories of the sectors in line with the low- carbon national strategy. The paper highlighted the different measures needed for the roadmap, among them the establishment of financing tools around R&D and industrial deployment; the need for long-term visibility on electricity prices to guarantee the viability of future investments; the prevention of carbon leakage through the introduction of a carbon border adjustment; creating tools allowing competitive and predictable access to low-carbon electricity; and working on the implementation of Carbon Contracts for Difference. 53 54 France France Industry - France Industrie Level of engagement: Member Alignment: aligned France Industrie expressed its support of carbon neutrality by 2050, where Horizon Europe should help European industry pursue the objective by investing on innovative processes and products. 55 56 It has highlighted the need for EU funding support for transition pathways.

        "text":"Introduction Public Policy Our Stance Individual Policies Our Activities Review of Membership List of Memberships Our Stance Climate-Related Policies In addition to BEVs, the IPCC also states that sustainable biofuels, low emissions hydrogen, and derivatives (including synthetic fuels) can support mitigation of CO 2 emissions from land transport. Toyota believes that these technologies have the potential to expand the options for achieving carbon neutrality at an early stage and is working with various companies and local governments for their expansion. We are studying the possibility of biofuels and synthetic fuels as a measure to reduce emissions from the in-use fleet of vehicles. To advance the technology, we are testing vehicles that use biofuels and synthetic fuels derived from biomass in races. However, in addition to technical and price challenges, the commercialization of these fuels requires public and private sectors to work together to raise awareness, establish a supply chain, and develop a system to evaluate CO 2 reduction effects. To accelerate these discussions, in Japan, we approached the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to establish a \"Public-Private Council for the Promotion of the Introduction of Synthetic Fuel (e-fuel)\" and are now participating in the discussions after it was established in September. Regarding hydrogen, we are selling our FCEV, MIRAI, and are also developing a hydrogen engine vehicle. Toyota is the world leader in Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology and in December 2020, we announced our second generation MIRAI. Including our first generation, we have sold more than 20,000 MIRAI globally (as of Sept. 2022). We also believe that fuel cell systems are effective for commercial vehicles, which require sufficient cruising range, payload capacity, and fuel supply in a short period of time, and we are working with various companies toward the early commercialization of FC commercial vehicles. In Japan, we are also participating in discussions at the \"Mobility Hydrogen Public-Private Conference\" newly established by METI. Toyota is accelerating the development of hydrogen engines in the harsh environment of motorsports. We are working to expand the options for \"producing\", \"transporting\" and \"using\" hydrogen, such as by powering our hydrogen engine vehicles with hydrogen derived from sewage biogas in Fukuoka City and green hydrogen produced in Yamanashi Prefecture while conducting demonstrations to improve the efficiency of hydrogen transportation. With each race, the number of companies, municipalities, and other organizations that share our enthusiasm and actions are increasing, and discussions toward the realization of a hydrogen society are steadily progressing. Regarding hydrogen refueling infrastructure, Toyota was one of the member companies to establish Japan H2 Mobility, LLC (JHyM) in 2018, and has been supporting the successful strategic deployment of hydrogen stations in Japan. Toyota's Stance on a Carbon Tax and Carbon Emissions Trading Toyota believes that CO 2 should be reduced by technological development and innovation. We support a system that is in line with each regional circumstance and promotes technological development\/innovation and is fair and equitable, effective, and feasible. We hope that our position is reflected in the Japanese government's ongoing discussions on carbon pricing. Toyota's Stance on the strengthening of Greenhouse Gas Regulations Toyota believes it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible since these gases are long-lived and therefore accumulate in the atmosphere over long periods of time. Early action is necessary. We support regulations that are predictable, technology neutral, and that allow us to provide safe and affordable vehicles to our customers. We support regulations that are integrated in an economy-wide, comprehensive energy and industrial policy. Further, we support deregulations and policies that promote the entire spectrum of measurers to reduce barriers to success such as infrastructure development, consumer purchase incentives, and other complimentary policy measures. 7 Toyota's Views on Climate Public Policies 2022",

        "text":"3 that would have the effect of delaying emissions reductions or reducing targets on individual emitters, must therefore be picked up by other scheme participants or other sectors of the economy. Our key messages Setting the Safeguard up for an enduring function One of the key steps to drive emissions reductions, especially in the early stages of the revised Safeguard, is the removal of 'headroom' 1 from overall targets, which requires careful setting of baselines across all facilities in order to deliver scheme-wide abatement. Meaningful baseline setting and removal of headroom are fundamental to the enduring function of the Safeguard Mechanism. Allowing headroom or direct provision of Safeguard Mechanism Credits (SMCs) to particular facilities could delay action on emissions reductions and also erode the value of SMCs, as each SMC would not represent a true cost of abatement. It could also place a larger decarbonisation burden on other sectors or facilities that were unable to access SMCs because of a particular baseline methodology, despite there being overall headroom across the scheme. All of these impacts would be highly detrimental to the operation of the scheme. While we are broadly supportive of a simple, low maintenance scheme where SMCs are automatically awarded for emissions reductions achieved, for the scheme to have real integrity, information and data on baselines and emissions reductions should be transparent and available to the public. In the current Safeguard Mechanism, there are instances where facilities are able to withhold baseline information under commercial claims. In our view, this is incompatible with an equitable scheme where all participants are seen to be taking on their fair share of emissions reductions. Impact of scheme design on ACCU market integrity If the scheme is well-designed, SMCs will reflect the true cost of carbon abatement, providing a strong price signal and encouraging investment in new, decarbonised technologies. ACCU market integrity should be considered in the setting of facility baselines. ACCUs are experiencing a period of high demand due to both mandatory ERF and voluntary contracts. The Safeguard Mechanism should support ACCU markets by generating competitively priced SMCs rather than contributing to ACCU market volatility by offering a low-cost, ineffective unit of compliance. Ineffective setting of baselines could also delay action on climate change. If there is oversupply of SMCs early on through poor scheme design, this will force stronger action in later years and mitigation timeframes will get tighter. The responsibilities of EITEs in an effective Safeguard Mechanism Under the current scheme, emissions-intensive trade-exposed facilities (EITEs) make up 78% of covered emissions and 56% of facilities. Allowing for complex, individually tailored treatment of each EITE would be complicated, expensive, and inefficient. We note that for some facilities and in 1 In this context, headroom refers to the gap between existing aggregate baselines (180 Mt CO 2 -e in FY21) and actual emissions from covered facilities (137 Mt CO 2 -e in FY21).",

Introduction: Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL) acknowledges the mainstream scientific direction on the existence of climate change. We support the international climate agreement developed at the 2015 Paris Conference of Parties, as well as the Nationally Determined Contributions of the countries in which we operate. We believe policy instruments can be an effective tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for a global, technology-neutral approach which delivers real reductions fairly and equitably. We support a just and orderly transition to a sustainable future which balances environmental, social and economic needs. We advocate for global cooperation on climate change and support domestic policies which assist our business to transition to a sustainable future while supporting the continued domestic location of our value chains (domestic energy sourcing, employment, manufacturing and customer supply) to reduce the environmental and social impacts associated with transport, carbon leakage and potential job losses. IPL welcomes and supports the following objectives and principles at 1.2 of the Safeguard Mechanism Reforms: Consultation paper :",

The most important levers to achieve this goal are the phase-out of coal, investment in renewable energies, an end to deforestation, and a switch to electro mobility. For Martina Merz, CEO of thyssenkrupp AG, the industry must play a key role in the energy transition and pull together with policymakers. Goodbye, coal - hello, renewables! Today, we are no longer as dependent on fossil fuels as we were a few decades ago. Nevertheless, many countries and energy suppliers continue to purchase fossil fuels, even though the technologies for sustainable energy generation and distribution have been available for a long time. The reason: there is a lack of investment in the construction of renewable energy plants and the expansion of efficient infrastructure. COP26 aims to drive this expansion in order to advance the final transition to a sustainable energy supply.",

        "text":"Level 8, 28 Freshwater Place, Southbank VIC 3006 3 | P a g e Key Principles: 1. The Safeguard Mechanism's share of abatement, like any sector's within a national plan, should be based on viable abatement pathways and the expected timelines for these. * IPL acknowledges the share of GHG emissions that Safeguard Facilities produce and supports research and investment to move every facility to Net Zero by 2050. * As part of this, the timing by which technologies for hard-to-abate industries will be available must be factored into Australia's overall Transition Plan, and therefore targets, to enable not only an effective, equitable, efficient and simple policy, but a reliable, economy- wide plan to reach 2030 targets to be developed. * That plan should prioritise the lowest cost, most feasible opportunities for emissions reduction across all sectors of the economy. * That plan should also recognise that some sector's decarbonisation, such as transport and many Safeguard Facilities, depends on achieving other milestones on the path to Net Zero, such as large amounts of low cost renewable electricity. The expected reduction trajectories of different sectors must be considered in the planning phase of Australia's overall Transition Plan, and therefore Australia's medium-term targets. For example, large amounts of low cost renewable electricity is required early in the transition for other sectors to decarbonise. This must be incentivised, planned and managed for both an orderly transition and meeting NDCs. 2. Production-adjusted (intensity-based) baselines are already in place for most facilities and provide a solution that is effective, equitable, efficient and simple. * IPL has invested considerable time in developing production-adjusted baselines for its Safeguard Mechanism facilities cross the past few years and supports retaining these. * Production-adjusted baselines ensure that emission reductions cannot be achieved by reducing a facility's output, which is important when crediting below baseline. Production-adjusted (intensity-based) incentivise GHG reductions while avoiding penalising businesses and the Australian economy for increasing domestic production. 3. Production-adjusted baselines should be set using industry-average emissions factors in order that early movers are not disadvantaged. * IPL built its Moranbah nitric acid plant in 2012 with secondary abatement of N2O in place. As a result, its current baseline was set with the reduction achieved by secondary abatement already removed from its baseline, while competitors' current baselines were set with no abatement in place. As a result, it is much easier for competitors to reduce emissions against baselines through the installation of abatement that IPL installed a decade ago. * New entrant baselines could be set using the industry average minus the percentage reduction which has been enacted since commencement of the scheme. Facilities outside of Australia may be required for averages where no Australian facility exists. Setting baselines using industry averages provides an equitable, level playing field for all facilities, particularly where crediting below baseline is being used.",
