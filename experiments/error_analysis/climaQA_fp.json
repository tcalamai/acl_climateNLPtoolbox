The wind farms are scheduled to be operational mid-2020 and are expected to generate enough zero-carbon electricity to offset the absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions of the US firm. Through these agreements, EY US is adding carbon-free energy supply to the grid and helping to power the US with cleaner energy sources. Additionally, support for the wind farms serve as a strategic tool to show the firm's commitment to the environment, enhance the firm's reputation and increase demand for renewable energy in the market. In addition, in FY20, EY Global committed to achieving carbon neutrality for all member firms by the end of 2020 by both reducing and offsetting the firm's total carbon emissions.",

We are taking a portfolio approach to sustainable cotton by procuring and supporting the market growth for a variety of more sustainable cotton sources. As our program continues to evolve, we are continuously addressing the need to move further into our materials supply chain due to the high level of impact at the growing/milling stage. A core component of our global sustainable cotton program is sourcing Better Cotton, which is produced by farmers in a way that is measurably better for the environment and farming communities. PVH joined the Better Cotton Initiative, a program that exists to make global cotton production better for the people who produce it, for the environment it grows in, and for the sector's future. In 2019 PVH set a target for 100% of the cotton we procure to be sustainably sourced by 2025.

We consider our inherent carbon intensity advantage over other surface modes such as long-haul truck to be a significant opportunity to increase revenues in particular portions of the business, most notably intermodal services. A significant amount of national greenhouse gas emissions in Canada comes from the transportation sector (roughly 28%), however freight rail only contributes 1% of that sector as a whole, despite moving a large amount of surface freight. According to an independent study by the Federal Railroad Administration, moving freight by rail is on average four times more efficient than transport by highway traffic with approximately 75 percent less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Customers are continually looking at ways to improve on their carbon footprint in their supply chain which provides an advantage to CP through an increased demand for our freight service.",
