The Act establishes a uniform natural gas leak classification standard for all Massachusetts natural gas utilities and a program that accelerates the replacement of aging natural gas infrastructure. The program enables companies, including MA Gas, to better manage the scheduling and costs of replacement. The Act also calls for the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) to authorize natural gas utilities to design and offer programs to customers that will increase the availability, affordability and feasibility of natural gas service for new customers. MA Gas filed the Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP) with the DPU on October 31, 2014. MA Gas' program accelerates the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system within 20 years. The GSEP includes a new tariff by which MA Gas collects the costs for the program on an annual basis. On April 30, 2015, the DPU approved the GSEP."}]}}

We manage the risk through our Energy Management Program (EMP), which consists of energy consumption monitoring and investments in energy conservation and efficiency improvement projects. We have an energy monitoring and targeting system in place, with an annual cost of $200k. Drivers like EU ETS and EU EED led us to consider process changes (e.g. replacement of outdated combustion equipment to more efficient equipment that can potentially reduce our energy load to below the 20MW regulatory threshold). From 2014-2018 we delisted certain sites from EU ETS as they fell below the total combustion capacity threshold. Wider best practice sharing and energy/GHG reduction projects are part of EMP, and they involve specific investments for an annual set budget of around $10M. Our EMP enables us to analyze consumptions and serve as basis for potential carbon tax exemptions and ''cost to comply\" reductions with the EU ETS. Over the last years, PMI has applied an internal carbon price of $17 per ton of CO2e in order to allocate capital for the best return in terms of carbon reduction and cost-effectiveness. As we are stepping up our ambition to reduce carbon emissions, we started a project to define a carbon price that will align with the 1.5-degree target and help to solidify the company's climate leadership and support an organic CO2 emissions contraction path. We select technologies based on clearly defined criteria: they must lead to an annual emissions reduction, have a payback period of no more than five years, and be among the more cost-effective projects in comparison to other carbon emissions reduction projects proposed within PMI. In Italy, we installed 6,660 square meters of photovoltaic panels in 2019, reaching the total of over 72,300 square meters globally.In 2019, as a consequence of the energy saving projects implemented, our manufacturing site in Italy only used the free allowances and was able to comply to EU ETS without the purchase of additional credits.Our annual cost of management is the sum of investments in energy conservation and efficiency initiatives (approx. $10M) and the energy monitoring system operating costs ($200k)."}]}}

The impact of individual risks is assessed in the following areas: Health/Safety/Environmental, Operational and Reliability, Regulation/Legal/Compliance, Financial. Upstream risks related to climate generally include regulation, technology, legal, market and reputation risks. These are all factored into our risk assessment. For example, our utility SDG&E depends on power generators for about 76% of the power delivered to customers. We face risk if, for example, any of these facilities fail to generate the specified amount of power, which could be impacted by climate-relate events such as extended drought. To mitigate these risks we we require our suppliers of capacity, through the procurement process, to describe in detail how they will deliver on their contract with us in times of water or natural gas-related shortages. We also assign all risk and related costs associated with non-delivery of contracted electricity to our suppliers."}]}}

These are Scope 3 emissions reductions that are critical to maintaining employee engagement, influencing how employees do their jobs, and further causing broader sustainable lifestyle changes. Programs include the promotion of energy efficiency at home, low impact vegetation management, wildlife appreciation, increased recycling (office and industrial) and a reduction in overall waste generation. Our grass-roots Eco-Team runs an annual ECO-challenge, a week-long event where employees across the corporation are challenged to make life style changes that result in GHG footprint reductions and the Eco-Warrior Challenge where employees are challenged to see how many carbon-reducing activities they can achieve in one day. Activities are translated into GHG reductions, and increase awareness of the collective impact our employees can have on improving the environment through simple changes in their behavior. Emissions savings as presented are the project based Scope 3 reductions associated with our Eco-Team employee events. These initiatives are voluntary and run from year to year. Investment relates to annual seed funding provided by Exelon to the EcoTeams. There are no corporate cost savings associated with these actions. Payback on the initiative is immediate with regard to employee engagement benefits. This is counted as one project implemented under 4.3a."}]}}

Railways move approximately 70% of all freight on a tonne-kilometre basis in Canada but only account for 3.3% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. Despite this inherent efficiency, CP recognizes the importance of continuing to strive for improvements in its operations to drive down emissions of greenhouse gases.CP's focus on climate change through improvements in locomotive fuel efficiency has allowed it to present a low carbon intensive option to remain competitive with other modes of transportation. According the Association of American Railroads, movement of freight by rail is an average four times more fuel-efficient than truck transport, which offers shippers an opportunity to move their products with less greenhouse gas emissions. CP continues to emphasize the need to improve operational efficiency to maintain this advantage into the future.https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/greenhouse-gas-emissions.htmlhttps://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissionshttp://www.bst-tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/rail/2018/sser-ssro-2018.html"}]}}

Using the average data method according to this standard, Praxair uses waste volumes provided by waste vendors and multiplies the waste treated by third parties for each waste treatment method by the associated emission factors. The amount of waste treated by third parties is recorded in our EKPI database according to the waste treatment methods (landfill, recycled, other). To calculate the CO2e emissions resulting from waste treated in landfills, Praxair multiplies the total amount of waste in this category by an emissions factor provided by the EPA, which is associated with the municipal waste mix in the United States. The IPCC suggests that any CO2e emissions associated with recycling should not be included in Scope 3 inventories. Therefore, Praxair uses an emissions factor of 0 for recycled waste treated by third parties. The small amount of waste which is not landfilled or recycled is calculated equally as if it were landfilled."}]}}

Storm activity accounts for less than 10% of Owens Corning's revenue. Specific to hurricanes, external sources suggest that destructive storms will increase in frequency and/or severity due to climate change. The IPCC projects ''an 80% increase in the frequency of Saffir-Simpson category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes over the next 80 years,\" and NOAA projects ''Tropical cyclone intensities globally will likely increase on average (by 1 to 10% according to model projections for a 2 degree Celsius global warming). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.\" Going by these sources, this range of values represents up to a 10% increase in storm activity in the long term. For every 5% increase in storm activity we estimate the impact to revenue to be approximately $30 million: thus the top estimated value in this range is $60 million for a 10% increase."}]}}

However, two potential drought-related projects could result in expenditures of $4-6M in capital costs. If drought results in loss of surface water due to a shortage declaration on the Colorado River, agricultural users near the Sundance Power Plant could revert to pumping groundwater. This new groundwater pumping could lower the water table to levels that require drilling a new, deeper well at a cost of $2-3M. A similar drought-related issue could occur at the Yucca Power Plant, where a shortage declaration on the Colorado River could result in loss of all but one well supporting the plant, requiring APS to drill a well to avoid having a single point of failure, at a cost of $2-3M."}]}}

Sealed Air is a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce our products, including plastic packaging materials. We often print customer specified brand information, nutritional information and consumer facing instructions on our packaging materials as part of the value we bring to our processing customers. The printing process can involve use of volatile organic compounds, the release of which are regulated. Understanding current regulations and assuring compliance is the responsibility of local teams with regional and corporate oversight. We monitor and report emissions in part to maintain operating permits. Regional regulations are locally and continuously monitored and possible risks are presented to local business continuity team members as they arise. Examples specific to Sealed Air are those related to printing. In Jaguariuna, Brazil, we installed new compressed air piping in the printing and racking machines, which require more pressure than the system replaced. The result is ~5% reduction in energy consumption and ~18,000 kg CO2e GHG annual reduction. We replaced solvent-based printing and lamination with solvent-less technologies in our Simpsonville, South Carolina facility."}]}}

It's virtually impossible to segregate costs associated with issues that can be singularly identified as ''climate change.\"For example, in response to potential transition risk involving our insurance-related segment, Verisk businesses have improved risk selection analytics, launched both new and updated natural catastrophe models, introduced coverage options for insurer customers to enter new markets, enhanced visualized claims platforms with weather analytics and aerial imagery during large-scale claim events, and added technological advancements that automate complex and time-consuming tasks that insurance adjustors and estimators typically perform manually.Costs associated with these activities are likely to emerge gradually over a long period of time and will be reflected in associated business and financial plans. Once incurred, they will be included as part of the expenses reported within Verisk's insurance, energy and financial service verticals. Similarly, we've initiated and remain committed to a long-term strategy to acquire and integrate renewable energy assets and expertise to address emerging needs encountered in our energy intelligence business. Prior acquisitions have included Greentech Media, an information services provider for the renewable sector and MAKE, a research and advisory business specializing in wind power. They formed the basis of Wood Mackenzie's Power and Renewables Group, launched in 2018, and which now provides solar, wind, storage and grid edge market intelligence services.The costs of acquisitions, such as those completed previously to expand the company's capabilities in the renewable energy segment, will be reported in public filings as they are incurred."}]}}

To support the deployment of zero- and low-emission vehicles the EU Commission plans to adapt the existing legislation such as: the 2014 Alternative fuels infrastructure directive and the 2013 Trans-European transport network regulation. This will likely have an impact on WBA's fleet vehicle operations across the EU."}]}}

Through our four strategic business units - Canadian Personal and Small Business Banking, Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, and Capital Markets - CIBC provides a full range of financial products and services to 11 million individual, small business, commercial, corporate and institutional clients in Canada, the U.S. and around the world. We have approximately 45,000 employees dedicated to providing our clients with banking that fits their lives, delivering consistent and sustainable earnings growth for our shareholders, and giving back to our communities. (<URL>) CIBC is pleased once again to be a participant to the CDP and we look forward to contributing to the CDP in the future. We recognize that climate change is an important environmental issue. Its physical effects, along with regulations designed to mitigate it, will have a measurable impact on communities and businesses. As such, we are committed to understanding and responsibly managing the regulatory and physical impacts of climate change on our business. As a service-based company, CIBC has relatively low carbon emissions. However, many of our clients operate businesses that are currently facing or will face new carbon emission regulations in the future. Furthermore, we recognize that there are opportunities to further improve our carbon emission performance that is associated with our operations, supply chain, and business activities. With this in mind, CIBC began examining climate change issues in 2002 and our efforts evolved into a carbon risk management program designed to assess and manage the impacts (both positive and negative) of climate change and climate change-driven regulations on our business operations and those of our clients. The on-going program consists of the following five elements: 1. Managing greenhouse gas emissions from CIBC's operations (our own climate change footprint); 2. Assessing the impacts of climate change regulation on CIBC's Credit Portfolio; 3. Tracking and assessing opportunities in emerging North American carbon markets; 4. Developing screening tools for climate change risk in credit risk assessment; and 5. Assessing the physical impacts of climate change to CIBC's operations and to our lending and investment portfolio. To learn more about our commitment to responsible environmental management, we encourage you to visit the CIBC and the Environment website (<URL>) or the Responsible Banking section of CIBC's 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report and Public Accountability Statement (<URL>). CIBC's response to the Carbon Disclosure Project questionnaire may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These statements may include material factors or assumptions that could cause CIBC's actual results in future periods to differ materially. For information, please refer to the note about forward-looking statements on page 1 of CIBC's Report to Shareholders for the Second Quarter, 2018 dated May 23, 2018. (<URL>)."}]}}

The increased produced water re-used served to partially diminish the risk of loss of surface water access. To support the reuse efforts and create more favourable project economics, 7G invested extensively in a produced water pipeline network and tank farm. This storage capacity enables drilling and completions to efficiently handle the produced water from operations, reduce downhole disposal requirements and provide the ability to optimize freshwater and produced water mixing for completions activities. Alongside the produced water transportation and storage operations, 7G continued to use its significant freshwater storage capacity in the form of fresh water storage ponds developed in 2016 and 2017. This freshwater is both piped and trucked to well pads. 7G's ponds store water collected during peak river flow periods which can be used by drilling and completions during low flow periods."}]}}

Many utility companies are required by state renewable portfolio standards to ensure that a percentage of electricity they sell comes from renewable sources. Working with their customers (like Praxair), utilities can achieve this by incentivizing energy efficiency, which can reduce the amount of non-renewable power needed. Praxair, by participating in these programs, reduces energy use and avoids GHG emissions, and saves money. Cost savings is a primary driver for these programs. For Praxair, energy is a large cost factor, representing 25-30 percent of Praxair's operational costs.We measure impact of our engagement by percent improvements in energy efficiency. For example: In 2018, Praxair's Ferndale, Washington, CO2 plant partnered with the local electricity utility Puget Sound Energy (PSE), the largest investor-owned utility in Washington, to develop and commission an automated demand response product. Praxair was the first customer in the utility's history to modulate our load automatically from a signal sent from the utility's grid control center. By allowing the utility to modulate our load, we are able to reduce kWh demand during peak periods and help the utility better balance supply with demand. This helps avoid power interruptions for us and for other PSE customers and decrease use of carbon-based peaker units. Praxair also installed a site energy management and supervisory control system that enabled site energy measurement and optimization in real time. Thanks to these measures, the Ferndale plant improved energy efficiency by 15%."}]}}

The BNY Mellon capital planning process includes a special allocation category for sustainability and energy saving initiatives. All sustainability initiatives estimate energy savings and return on investment. Typical return on investment for funded projects is less than three years. BNY Mellon discusses and manages these strategies internally through regularly scheduled monthly meetings with key staff of Corporate Real Estate, Sustainability and finance. BNY Mellon communicates the actions and results of its GHG reduction efforts internally through the intranet and externally to the Board of Directors and the public via publications such as the CSR Report. As an example of this management method, in 2018, the company replaced HVAC systems with more efficient models in two offices in Florida. The total costs of managing this opportunity is estimated to be $8.6 million in capital project expenditures which is calculated as the total cost spent on capital projects that could have an energy efficiency component in 2018."}]}}

BNY Mellon helps clients and the financial services industry create positive impact through specific investment management and investment services the company provides. This item is listed as a risk because of the potential to either miss a market opportunity in some magnitude, or because of an inherently higher risk exposure in investments not considering ESG-related criteria. Minimizing this risk in the future requires further commitment to ESG-strategies, due diligence, and portfolio risk assessment in the future.An example of BNY Mellon's response to this risk is the ESG Client Solutions Working Group (ESGWG). The ESGWG convenes ESG leaders from across BNY Mellon's lines of business and functions, with the aim to develop leading ESG solutions that address clients' needs.During 2019, BNY Mellon's investment firms conducted internal ESG training, appointed several RI-dedicated personnel, participated in collaborative engagements, supported education through speaking engagements and thought leadership, and continued exploration of RI product capabilities. Notably, in 2019: Insight bolstered its methodology for proprietary corporate ESG risk scores, Mellon created an internal guide to its direct engagement efforts and remodelled its proxy voting committee; and Newton expanded its sustainable investment suite and played leading roles in key engagement initiatives. In 2019 BNY Mellon was appointed by the Republic of Chile as trustee for Latin America's first sovereign green bond issuance totalling $2.5 billion for renewable energy projects, infrastructure for electrified transport, water management projects and eco-friendly buildings. In 2019, the company's team in Australia supported the financing of one of Elliott Green Power's solar energy projects. This green loan was verified against the Climate Bonds Standard criteria for low carbon contribution to solar electricity generation.The $900,000 estimated cost or risk response was calculated by using median estimates for the salaries of dedicated ESG and responsible-investing analysts which support this work at several of BNY Mellon's Investment Management firms."}]}}

Hess is a founding member of the ONE Future Coalition, which is comprised of companies from across the natural gas industry and focuses on identifying policy and technical solutions that yield continuous improvement in the management of methane emissions associated with the production, processing, transportation and distribution of natural gas. In 2017 Hess became an initial participant in API's Environmental Partnership, which is furthering action to reduce air emissions associated with natural gas and oil production. Hess participates in three separate programs established by the Partnership: Leak Program for Natural Gas and Oil Production Sources; Program to Replace, Remove or Retrofit High-Bleed Pneumatic Controllers; and Program for Manual Liquids Unloading for Natural Gas Production Sources. For example, Hess has implemented an LDAR program at all of our production facilities in North Dakota and Ohio as well as at our gas plants in Texas and North Dakota, which encompass 68% of our total operated methane emissions. This program comprises monthly audible, visual and olfactory inspection of our equipment with the potential to leak and semi-annual optical gas imaging to detect fugitive emissions. The implementation cost is approximately $2 million per year, which results in controlled emissions of approximately 117 million scf/yr at an average cost of $17.75 per MSCF."}]}}

This report also estimated that widespread deployment of ICT could save up to 10 times the carbon emissions generated by the sector itself by 2030. By using certain of Bell's products and services (P&S), our customers' carbon emissions could be reduced. Incidentally, we have developed a methodology in collaboration with Groupe AGECO to quantify the environmental benefits specific to Bell's P&S. Our analysis concludes that in 2017, Bell P&S enabled carbon abatement for our customers of more than 885 kt, which is equivalent to 2.5 times as much as our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This analysis confirms that our P&S have a significant carbon abatement potential that we showcased in our 2018 Corporate Responsibility report and at numerous events including COP23 in Bonn, and that we intend to continue promoting going forward. Examples of such P&S enabling carbon abatement include remote collaboration tools (e.g. Bell Total Connect, Audio/Web Conferencing services) reducing travel needs, virtualization (e.g. Bell Business Cloud) encouraging optimal use of space, power & cooling resources by consolidating servers and storage, and green data centres (e.g. Bell Hosting services) improving energy efficiency."}]}}

We consider catastrophic weather events in our business continuity plans and have storm plans for f events that may occur in the service territory. Specific examples of this in the 2017 10K and 2018 Annual Report: ''In addition, the physical risks of severe weather events, such as experienced from Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy, and of climate change, changes in sea level, temperature and precipitation patterns and other related phenomena have further exacerbated these risks.\" (PSEG 2017 10K p. 37)''We also continued progress in our three-year, $905 million Gas System Modernization Program, replacing an aging system of cast-iron and unprotected steel gas mains to improve reliability and safety, and to curb emissions of climate-damaging methane.We continue to move ahead with our post-Superstorm Sandy Energy Strong program to harden and improve the resiliency of our electric and gas systems against extreme weather.\" (PSEG 2017 Annual Report p.9) . In June 2018, we filed for Energy Strong Program II (ESP II), a proposed five-year $2.5 billion program to harden, modernize and make our electric and gas distribution systems more resilient (PSEG 2018 2Q Form 10-Q p90)Also, as a result of events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the NRC began performing additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the United States. These reviews and the lessons learned from the events in Japan have resulted in additional regulation and implementation guidance for the nuclear industry and could impact future operations and capital requirements for our facilities. We believe that our nuclear plants currently meet the stringent applicable design and safety specifications of the NRC.We have implemented the diverse and flexible mitigating strategies and spent fuel pool level indication modifications in accordance with the regulatory requirements at the Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom nuclear units. For our Hope Creek and Peach Bottom units, implementation of the required venting system modifications is expected to be completed by 2018."}]}}

We consider our inherent carbon intensity advantage over other surface modes such as long-haul truck to be a significant opportunity to increase revenues in particular portions of the business, most notably intermodal services. A significant amount of national greenhouse gas emissions in Canada comes from the transportation sector (roughly 28%), however freight rail only contributes 1% of that sector as a whole, despite moving a large amount of surface freight. According to an independent study by the Federal Railroad Administration, moving freight by rail is on average four times more efficient than transport by highway traffic with approximately 75 percent less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Customers are continually looking at ways to improve on their carbon footprint in their supply chain which provides an advantage to CP through an increased demand for our freight service."}]}}

To this number we applied a correction factor, usually 98%, representing the flight segments for which we had primary data. (Previously, analysis of financial accounts indicated that employees were consistently using our global travel provider for 98% of our travel, so we only needed to boost calculated travel to account for the additional 2% from travel arranged outside our global travel provider.Cisco is no longer reporting business travel against a GHG emissions reduction goal, instead we are using linear trending based on 11 years (2007-2017) of actual flight segment data and calculated emissions. Over the last 8 years, air travel has increased on a steady linear basis, likely driven by growth in company revenue and/or employee count. The strong correlation between revenue and business travel emissions (R^2 = 0.93) suggests extrapolating year on year emissions is appropriate for the desired accuracy when there has been no significant change in business conditions that could disrupt travel spend."}]}}

Facility-level risks are documented as part of Business Continuity Plans, managed at the facility level and monitored at a corporate level. Enterprise Risk Management, is responsible for the implementation of consistent and effective processes for risk identification, monitoring and mitigation, and event management related to employee and environmental protection, facilities and assets, products, compliance, reputation and communications as well as integration with existing business functions. Risk management is integrated into processes including strategic planning, brand planning, performance management, disclosure, and crisis management, including disruption in supply chain continuity including from natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism. Certain acute physical risks such as flooding are also evaluated at each manufacturing and R&D facility, as part of comprehensive multi-year global water source and wastewater risk assessments. Since the project's inception, 100% or 13 of 13 manufacturing and R&D sites have been evaluated for water source and wastewater risk. As an example of a relevant risk, our manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico sustained impacts to the facilities as a result of Hurricane Maria. Informed by our recent risk assessment results and business strategy, BMS is pursuing a detailed feasibility study for an LNG fueled CHP driven microgrid project at one of our sites in Puerto Rico, in partnership with two other industrial companies on the island. Results of the study are ongoing."}]}}

We expect to see more GHG emissions regulations and are well positioned to service our customers with expertise and support. Starting in 2009, we assembled an Alternative Fuels and Vehicles Strategy Team to review alternative fuel platforms and to identify new market opportunities. In 2010, Ryder expanded these efforts with an Alternative Fuel Natural Gas Council. In 2015, Ryder announced one of the largest investments in its advanced energy portfolio: the launch of a new online NGV maintenance training program for its entire North American maintenance network. The program provides the technician workforce with knowledge of NGV platforms and configurations to better serve customers who commit to converting all or part of their fleets. And in 2019, Ryder committed to investing in electric vehicle technology vehicles and infrastructure at its FMS locations. ii) To date, Ryder NG vehicles travelled over 280 million miles, and replaced over 42 million gallons of diesel fuel with lower emission natural gas. Ryder partnered with Anheuser-Busch to replace 66 of the beer company's diesel tractors with compressed natural gas (CNG) powered engines. With one of the largest fleets in the US, Ryder plays a leadership role in the natural gas market. Additionally, Ryder added certified clean idle vehicles to its fleet meeting the EPA 2010 emissions standard. Ryder invests in purchasing strategies including evaluation of the environmental and performance standards of suppliers.We will continue to invest in state-of-the-art vehicles, fleet management and diagnostic technologies that expand these capabilities and maximize vehicle performance, cargo routing, fuel usage, and driving skills. For example, Ryder has invested $100 million to offer customers natural gas vehicles; has 61 NGV compliant maintenance facilities and more than 6,200 NGV trained technicians and support employees across the US and Canada."}]}}

We engage specifically in North Dakota because this is our most significant onshore operation and an area where our strategy is to reduce flaring through infrastructure investment and technology related solutions. We engaged specifically with two suppliers because they offered the most innovative technologies with regards to our needs. One supplier has a product that takes gas that would otherwise be flared and condenses the gas into a saleable natural gas liquids product. Another supplier provides flexible pipe that is used to transport water used in our operations rather than delivering water via tank trucks. Both of these products are new to oil field operations and result in reduced GHG emissions."}]}}

Companies that have already performed life-cycle assessments have an opportunity to get ahead of competition, as these analyses are time consuming and implementation can be slow. For example, the company's work to improve set-top box efficiency has proven useful in the face of increasing government regulation on the energy use of consumer electronics. Through supply chain and life-cycle assessments, News Corp has already measured major product categories, and by working with key suppliers has reduced the carbon footprint and manufacturing cost of key products.Because the costs of these actions are combined with other sustainability and business initiatives and strategies, it is difficult to provide precise investment figures. However, News Corp continues to invest strategically in sustainability, including in energy efficiency, systems for measuring and tracking energy usage, and analyses of supply chains to find opportunities for improvement."}]}}

Converting from cast iron piping to plastic can reduce methane emissions by 95%. All three utilities are long time members of the EPA's Natural Gas Star program and in April 2016 committed to the Methane Reduction Challenge - establishing a goal to replace cast iron mains in the system at a minimum rate of 2% per year through 2021. Performance against this goal has continued to be strong, with 87 miles of cast iron main (over 3%) in 2017. This effort is counted as 3 projects implemented (relating one each to BGE, Delmarva and PECO), with a similar 3 projects to be implemented in 2018, under question 4.3a. Emissions, investment and cost savings which are provided are related to the 2017 pipe cast iron and unprotected steel pipe replacement projects implemented at BGE, Delmarva and PECO combined. Cost has been estimated based on approximately $2 million per mile replaced. Actual cost may differ depending on actual project location and circumstances. As investment benefits are beyond GHG emissions reductions and include performance and safety improvement, simple ROI analysis is not appropriate for this initiative."}]}}

For 87% of our customers (by revenue), we provide additional educational materials in the form of product Eco Declarations for notebooks like ThinkPads, tablets, desktops, workstations, servers and storage, and monitors. These documents include information about energy consumption, ENERGY STAR status, etc. In addition, we also post Product Carbon Footprint information for many products in these same product categories.We have chosen to engage with 87% of our customers in this manner because these products are sold directly to many customers (either large enterprise customers or household consumers) and we are these customers' primary source of information on our products. For the remaining 13% of customers, they are related to our mobile phone business. In many geographies, Lenovo does not directly engage with consumers for these products rather we engage with mobile phone carriers interface with consumers. Because of this difference in how we engage with this customer segment, for our carrier customers, we provide information during the RFP process or directly upon request. In addition to these types of educational communications, Lenovo directly engages our customers via responding to customer questions and RFPs and also in person meetings in customer briefings in our briefing center and through calls with our sales team and customers. In general, all customer requests for information related to GHG emissions and climate change strategies are responded to, generally with publicly available data that Lenovo has already published. Many customers have questions about Lenovo's climate change strategy, our policy, our specific goals, our progress, and measurements related to products. Environmental team staff are frequently called upon to speak with customers either via conference calls or in person at Lenovo's locations around the world."}]}}

This data was used to create a weighted average emission factor for Rogers' paper in sum, and this factor is applied to paper for which GHG emission data is unavailable. Each year, updated paper consumption data (including the paper manufacturer and paper tonnage) is collected for the following activities: Publishing, Marketing, Billing Office copy paper, company letterhead and business cards Paper: The consumption of purchased paper in calculated by the determination that purchased paper has a cost of carbon to produce and may eventually finds its way into a landfill. The 2019 Reporting year reflected a reduction of 36.9% since 2018 and 89.8% since our base year of 2011, due primarily to our digitization across all our business operations.Paper consumption has decreased year over year due to our company wide digitization program, our divesting in print publications and our converting our customers to e-billing vs the conventional paper bills (74% in the Reporting Year vs 68% in 2018 and 35% in our base year of 2011). In our base year of 2011 paper emission were 2.2% of our total Scope 1, 2, & 3 emissions while it has reduced to 1% in the Reporting Year.All emissions calculations are based in the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocols"}]}}

As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), we have established a formal process for engaging with our suppliers on a variety of issues related to climate change, including energy consumption and GHG emissions, water use, and hazardous substances. In 2017, we engaged with our strategic suppliers to report data on their carbon, water and waste footprints via the RBA platform, aiming to achieve a supplier response rate of 85% based on hardware spend. Oracle leverages quarterly scorecards for our strategic suppliers, and provides training to new supplier managers around quarterly SER deliverable requests and why they are important.In addition, Oracle is an active member of the RBA Environmental Sustainability working group, and contributed to revising language in the code, addressing energy and water issues in the supply chain. Oracle also evaluated the RBA environmental maturity model to determine how it may be applied to our own strategic manufacturing suppliers, in addition to being leveraged by other RBA members. These efforts help us to not only educate our supply chain on various climate related issues and strategies, but also to help us manage our own environmental impact, and that of our products."}]}}

In the example with Alberta's Climate Leadership Plan, CP has been able to provide a critical service to advance Alberta's goals. Due to the size of the turbine materials (for example, one blade takes up three railcars), shipping and handling of these materials requires a large land footprint and specialized crane equipment to support windfarm development. Leveraging CP's available network property resources and operational agility, CP has been able to accommodate Alberta's needs and realize a partnership opportunity that will continue for another 5 years.While there are no significant costs associated with realizing these opportunities, there is effort required to prepare for transporting wind turbines. Due to the large land area required to unload wind turbine materials, CP had to dedicate swaths of land for the cranes and other equipment to be able to load and unload the materials on trains. There was no cost given the existing land owned by the railroad."}]}}

However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss.Our emergency response protocols follow the framework of the Crisis Management Plan, which is used to develop and implement separate Emergency Response and BCPs for offices and business units. These plans align with Corporate polices, guidelines, and methodologies. Disaster Recovery Planning covers data centers, networks, applications supporting operations, communications systems, and general technology recovery after a disaster.We rely on BCPs to increase operational resiliency should we experience local or regional disasters, including those that can be induced or amplified by climate change. We have experienced several such events in recent years, like Hurricane Harvey in 2017 that impacted our Houston office for 2 weeks. In this example, we activated BCPs to relocate staff and resume operations at unaffected sites outside of the hurricane's impact area. We are now also planning crisis and business continuity exercises that include events like tidal flooding that are likely to increase in frequency and magnitude as climate changes progresses."}]}}

These investments are key to reducing the Company's carbon footprint, as electricity accounts for most of its emissions. In fiscal 2018 electricity represented 92.3 percent of the WBA carbon footprint from energy, reflecting use of electricity to power its retail stores and warehouses. During fiscal 2018 Walgreens invested more than $115 million in energy efficiency programs, including projects in approximately 2,500 stores. These upgrades included replacing HVAC units and converting to LED exterior and interior lighting. In Boots UK PS14.4 million ($19.4 million) was invested during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018 a chiller doors initiative was successfully piloted at Boots UK stores to gauge customer acceptance. As of August 31, 2018 Boots UK has installed doors on refrigerated cabinets containing self-service food products in more than 160 stores, with an EnergyCare message to support a positive response."}]}}

However, we feel it is important not only to help our clients meet the challenges of assessing and addressing their own direct impacts, but also tackle those wider and typically greater impacts generated at the end-consumer level. Increasingly organizations understand that a significant portion of their climate change impacts lie with how consumers interact with their services and products, and tackling these impacts presents them with business advantages as well as new business models to develop. We recognize that there are a host of opportunities we can advise on to ensure clients reap the rewards of changing consumer behaviour to ultimately reduce the climate change impact their products and services have. If we were not able to stay abreast of changing end-consumer behaviour or maintain our expertise, or if we were not strategic or robust in our approach, we might not be able to take full advantage of these opportunities. We see this risk as low because, to date, we have worked closely with some of the most forward-thinking organizations globally to realize significant reductions in certain products' and services' climate change impacts and strengthen stakeholder relationships. We advise clients on how to change consumer behaviour. For example, through advice to a confidential financial services client, we carried out a comparative ISO-Conformant life cycle assessment (LCA) on physical and virtual products to determine the comparative GHG emissions and water consumption of each of its products. This advice was used to support the internal decision-making and external marketing for customer awareness."}]}}

A core component of our global sustainable cotton program is sourcing Better Cotton, which is produced by farmers in a way that is measurably better for the environment and farming communities. PVH joined the Better Cotton Initiative, a program that exists to make global cotton production better for the people who produce it, for the environment it grows in, and for the sector's future.

TOMS includes incident, emergency and crisis management programs to ensure TC Energy can effectively respond to operational risk events, minimize loss or injury and enhance our ability to resume operations. This is supported by our business continuity program that identifies critical business processes and develops corresponding business resumption plans. The procedures included in our Emergency Management Program (within TOMS) manage our response to natural disasters, which include catastrophic events such as forest fires, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes. The procedures are designed to help protect the health and safety of our employees, minimize risk to the public and limit the potential for adverse effects on the environment. We also have a comprehensive insurance program to mitigate a certain portion of these risks, but insurance does not cover all events in all circumstances.

Eaton achieved more than $280 million year-over-year synergy profits since our Cooper Industries acquisition in 2012. This multi-year profit growth represents a powerful accelerator to the organic growth that emanates from our expanded set of global power management capabilities. We estimate that research and development investments could help raise segment Eaton segment margins from 16.8% in 2018 to 17.1-17.5% in 2019. In 2018, a 1% increase in segment margins would have represented an increase in segment operating profit of about $215 million, a large impact for the company.

Eversource has teamed up with Denmark-based Orsted (formerly DONG Energy) on a joint venture to develop Bay State Wind, a proposed offshore wind farm that will be located off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, in an area that has the potential to develop at least 2,000 MW--enough electricity to power one million homes. Eversource and Orsted will seek to jointly develop, construct and operate this utility-scale offshore wind project in a 50-50 partnership. Orsted is the global leader in offshore wind, and will use its market leading expertise in the sector to lead the development and construction of the project's offshore generation and transmission assets. As the premier transmission builder in New England, Eversource will leverage its strong transmission expertise to develop and construct the onshore transmission system. Bay State Wind jointly owns a lease to develop a 300-square-mile ocean area located 15-25 miles south of the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The development of offshore wind in the Northeast is in its beginning phase and Bay State Wind will play an active role in its development. New England states and New York are expected to procure approximately 7,000 MW of offshore wind over the next decade.The project is expected to reduce emissions in the New England region by approximately 488,000 metric tons of CO2e annually. The calculation of the reduction of CO2e emissions from the Bay State Wind project is based on 400 MW capacity and a 45% capacity factor."}]}}

We continually strive to work with best-in-class partners who share our Core Values and approach to CR from both a human rights and environmental perspective. Over the past few years, we have evolved our supplier program in a number of meaningful ways to take our program to the next level and respond to a new wave of pressing issues.We recognize the importance of the environmental impact of our suppliers. We include environmental criteria in full (''long form\") supplier assessments (this applies to approximately two thirds of new suppliers). The assessments are implemented and managed by assessors, regional leads, report QA and brand liaisons, and overseen by the CR leadership, through regular updates and escalations when necessary. We evaluate assessments at the regional level, with controls at the brand liaison and report QA levels. The CR leadership is responsible for oversight. In our CDP Water questionnaire (question W1.4a), we share that 76-100% of total procurement spend is represented by the suppliers participating in the Factory Assessment Program. Here, we state 76% as the lower-end of that range, in an effort to maintain consistency."}]}}

With the launch of our 2030 Global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Strategy, we are elevating our commitment by focusing efforts where they can have the most impact: empowering makers, innovating with purpose and creating a more sustainable world. It's the way we put our purpose into action, and it's integral to our 22/22 Vision ($22 Billion in revenue by the year 2022). Our commitment to becoming a force for good builds on our legacy of keeping a keen focus on environment, health and safety, sustainability and community engagement. Across our businesses, we're investing in breakthrough innovation and digital excellence, striving for outperformance and increasing our focus on social responsibility. We prove our commitment to a sustainable world every day--by being a force for change where we work and live and holding ourselves and our suppliers to high standards in three vital aspects of doing business: people, product, and planet. We focus on these three areas through our ECOSMART\u2122\ufe0f plan and embed environmental awareness into everything we do, across our entire value chain. We entrench responsible design principles and practices into our products, encompassing everything from safety and ergonomics, to reducing the environmental impacts of material sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, customer use and end of life.

In 2019, we added new features and cities to the tool. Google Maps has transit information for nearly 11,000 agencies, running through more than 4.3 million transit stations, in over 100 countries. As a result, Google Maps provides, on average, over 1 billion km worth of transit results every day. As another example, Google works to accelerate the development of renewable energy by procuring renewable energy for our operations and through renewable energy investments; to promote electricity market reforms that unlock access to carbon-free power around the world; and to build and run some of the most efficient data centers in the world. As a result, all these efforts can have positive impacts on our reputation and potentially increase demand for Google's products and services. Google has various significant longstanding and ongoing investments in sustainability, some of which have been announced publicly, while other investments remain confidential. In addition to these investments, one of the costs associated with properly addressing climate change opportunities and impacts is the staff time to manage key initiatives on sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. As a rough estimate, this may be approximately $13 million per year. The median employee total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $258,708, as reported on page 49 of Alphabet's Notice of 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement. Managing these initiatives may hypothetically require the workload of approximately 50 full-time employee equivalents (FTEs), however, this may vary over time and may not be representative of the workload resources currently dedicated to these initiatives. This hypothetical cost figure was calculated as follows: ($258,708 x 50 FTEs) = $12,935,400."}]}}

In 2018 we asked 93 key suppliers, to respond to the CDP Supply Chain and received 61 responses, for a response rate of 66%. This is 6% higher than the previous year. We also regularly monitor key supplier performance through a range of tools, including questionnaires, surveys, reference checks, publicly available information and site visits. During 2017 (2018 numbers pending), Bristol-Myers Squibb conducted 64 EHS assessments of suppliers and third-party manufacturers. We may send an EHS questionnaire (which have components of climate change integrated into them) to third-party manufacturers that manufacture, finish or package Bristol-Myers Squibb products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), intermediates or other critical non-commodity materials. Based on the results of the questionnaire, we may conduct an on-site evaluation. The evaluation team when conducting an on-site evaluation, will make observations that must be addressed by the supplier in the form of a documented corrective and preventive action plan (CAPA). The CAPA is then tracked by the evaluation team lead to closure and verified as closed during the next subsequent site visit. The questionnaire or site visit may be repeated periodically, based on a risk-based model."}]}}

We manage the risk through our Energy Management Program (EMP), which consists of energy consumption monitoring and investments in energy conservation and efficiency improvement projects. We have an energy monitoring and targeting system in place, with an annual cost of $200k. Drivers like EU ETS and EU EED led us to consider process changes (e.g. replacement of outdated combustion equipment to more efficient equipment that can potentially reduce our energy load to below the 20MW regulatory threshold). From 2014-2018 we delisted certain sites from EU ETS as they fell below the total combustion capacity threshold. Wider best practice sharing and energy/GHG reduction projects are part of EMP, and they involve specific investments for an annual set budget of around $10M. Our EMP enables us to analyze consumptions and serve as basis for potential carbon tax exemptions and ''cost to comply\" reductions with the EU ETS. Over the last years, PMI has applied an internal carbon price of $17 per ton of CO2e in order to allocate capital for the best return in terms of carbon reduction and cost-effectiveness. As we are stepping up our ambition to reduce carbon emissions, we started a project to define a carbon price that will align with the 1.5-degree target and help to solidify the company's climate leadership and support an organic CO2 emissions contraction path. We select technologies based on clearly defined criteria: they must lead to an annual emissions reduction, have a payback period of no more than five years, and be among the more cost-effective projects in comparison to other carbon emissions reduction projects proposed within PMI. In Italy, we installed 6,660 square meters of photovoltaic panels in 2019, reaching the total of over 72,300 square meters globally.In 2019, as a consequence of the energy saving projects implemented, our manufacturing site in Italy only used the free allowances and was able to comply to EU ETS without the purchase of additional credits.Our annual cost of management is the sum of investments in energy conservation and efficiency initiatives (approx. $10M) and the energy monitoring system operating costs ($200k)."}]}}

Hilton reserves the right to conduct unannounced assessments, audits and inspections of supplier facilities to ensure that reasonable efforts are being taken by our suppliers to operate in a manner consistent with the fundamental principles of this Responsible Sourcing Policy. Violations may lead to disciplinary action, including termination of the supplier relationship for repeated violations or noncompliance. Specific to climate-related impacts, our Commitment to the Environment section of the policy states that: Hilton continually strives to minimize the amount of waste we generate and energy we consume. Our goal is to continually move towards the use of renewable materials and biodegradable substances wherever practicable and financially feasible. As Hilton provides information to its stakeholders on how we effectively manage our environmental performance, we further rely upon our suppliers to provide similar information and work collectively toward this goal. Throughout the term of the relationship, and otherwise at Hilton's request, suppliers are to provide information on its efforts to identify, monitor and minimize the environmental impacts of its operations. Additional climate-related supplier objectives can be found in our upload Responsible Sourcing Policy. Measures of success: As part of our new Travel with Purpose 2030 targets, we have committed to measure the success of our supplier engagement programs by encouraging our suppliers to set goals, and then validate those goals through an auditing and incentive program. We are working with our Supply Management team to define the exact processes that will be implemented for this program."}]}}

The NSPS XXX and EG Cf include a more stringent emissions threshold (limit) compared to the 1996 MSW Landfill rules still in effect (40 CFR 60 Subpart WWW and 40 CFR 60 Subpart Cc), triggering earlier installation of control technology and requiring extended operation of control technology. The new rules also require additional surface emissions monitoring. More importantly, however, the rules failed to address overlapping requirements between the old and new rules as well as the existing National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for MSW Landfills (40 CFR 63 Subpart AAAA) and Title V permit conditions which will apply simultaneously, triggering potential conflicts among requirements and confusion for state regulators and regulated entities. To further complicate matters, EPA is under court order to finalize revisions to the NESHAPs by March 2020 that may or may not align with the 2016 rule requirements. This confusion creates the potential for penalties and fines, which may negatively impact our ability to get municipal contracts, as well as our reputation with the investment community, which monitors regulatory compliance. The increased compliance costs could increase annual costs to WM by $10M."}]}}

It creates a marketing opportunity to showcase products that are industry leaders, increasing demand for Xerox products and in turn, our market share. For example, the US ENERGY STAR standard/eco-label specification for Imaging Equipment is introducing progressively more stringent energy efficiency requirements over time and for a broader range of products (the Version 3.0 specification is expected to be finalized in 2019). While not a regulation, compliance with Energy Star is a default requirement for many customers and is regularly referenced in public sector procurement requirements, along with other eco-labels including Blue Angel and EPEAT. This creates a potential opportunity for Xerox to be an earlier adopter of the V3.0 specification and/or provide a broader range of ENERGY STAR products. In March 2017, Xerox launched 29 new ConnectKey-enabled products. ConnectKey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the cloud without the security risks that commonly exist. Cloud computing is an alternative to large data centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data centers while generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Xerox ConnectKeya\"C/ and Cisco EnergyWise enable energy management by allowing for control, management, and reporting of a device's power consumption and the setting of power states and timeout intervals."}]}}

These reductions can be achieved through energy efficiency projects such as recent projects to upgrade lighting and HVAC systems. In addition, we recognize that the use of more efficient modes of transportation also have a positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions. We use rail vs truck when possible to minimize emissions and 90% of all trucks delivering our products are Smartway carriers (reported in 2019 for data year 2018). Our engineering processes are continuously evaluating and implementing more efficient systems at our plants. This includes installation of 6 new palletizers at our largest home care plant, adding a more efficient production lines at our Kansas liter plant, and a new method for processing wood chips at one of our Kingsford plants.We track our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions to document the efficiency gains and cost reductions as well as to assist with reporting requirements in support of our energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals as well as external reporting. In addition reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency will have a positive impact on future potential costs associated with cap and trade schemes and taxes on carbon, fuel and energy."}]}}

Reduction methods are implemented at a facility level and include conservation with behavioral activities, improving equipment efficiency to reduce, and reuse. When plants are located in water-stressed areas, special consideration is given to water treatment technologies. A Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system was installed at our San Luis Potisi, Mexico facility that produces vehicles and transmissions and is being operated to reuse water in the process, reduce withdrawal from deep wells, and reduce the risk of lack of water for production while providing an opportunity to continue production without interruption. The installed cost was $12M and ongoing operations are $200k"}]}}

Brand sustainability leads work within individual markets and departments including Development, Operations, and Supply Chain. Our Risk Assessment process for Market risks is consistent with our overall risk management framework: corporate and brand cross-functional teams collaborate to identify, study, and rank new and/or emerging risks. Once risks are identified, teams will develop mitigation plans. These risk assessments are then included in strategic business reviews as well as Compliance Oversight Committee and Audit Committee meetings as appropriate. For example, consumers are showing preferences for sustainable packaging, and the resulting market forces have encouraged us to take action. KFC announced a new global pledge that all plastic-based, consumer-facing packing will be recoverable or reusable by 2025. Such actions will hopefully ensure continued customer preference, a reduction of climate-related risks, and reduced emissions in the long-term."}]}}

Each Regional VP is responsible for monitoring the regulatory environment and ensuring their operations are compliant with all applicable regulations. The Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for maintaining awareness of climate-related regulations globally and helping to identify risk and opportunity within these regulations, based on input from Regional VPs. Current regulatory risks are discussed at each biannual Sustainability Steering Committee meeting. Climate-related regulatory risk is incorporated into Greif's Enterprise Risk Management process, which is reviewed quarterly by Greif's Audit Committee and ELT, and annually by Greif's Board of Directors. Greif's most recent risk reviews have identified current compliance and regulatory risk as a moderate risk factor with potential impact evident within six to 12 months. For example, our Chinese RIPS operations are subject to strict air quality regulations set by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. If air quality falls below yellow alert levels, the government will request that manufacturers shut down operations until air quality returns to a safe level. Greif's Tianjin facility was shut down twice in 2017 as a result of these regulations, resulting in seven days of lost production time. Similar mandated shut-downs could reoccur at any time, representing risk of lost revenues as a result of climate-related regulations. As such, this, and similar climate-related regulations, are relevant and always included in our Enterprise Risk Management process, as described in C2.2b. Further, per our 2018 10K, we are subject to transportation safety regulations set by the U.S. Department of Transportation and similar agencies in other jurisdictions. These regulations and standards set forth requirements related to the transportation of both hazardous and nonhazardous materials in some of our packaging products and subject Greif to random inspections and testing to ensure compliance. As transportation, and reducing emissions related to the transportation of our products, is a critical component of our climate strategy, the implications of these regulations are relevant to, and thus always included in. our climate-related risk assessments."}]}}

Research areas include solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment, operation and maintenance, solar resource forecasting, wind generation, biomass-fueled power generation and bulk-power system integration of variable generation sources.Over the past 10 years, we have made major investments in smart grid technologies including deploying approximately 4.6 million smart meters, or advanced metering infrastructure, helping customers better manage their energy use and save money. We are also conducting collaborative, industry-wide research with EPRI, for the ongoing development of transmission system monitoring, diagnostics and visualization tools that will facilitate decisions and mitigation measures to enhance system performance, efficiency and reliability.Our long and successful history of incorporating distributed generation into our energy mix began in the late 1970s and continues today. In April 2017, PowerSecure extended its distributed infrastructure offering by acquiring Power Pro-Tech Services, a distributed power system service provider that specializes in distributed power systems including fuel cells, solar inverters and controls that can be used to create microgrids for use by customers. In addition, Gulf Power is operating a 1 MWh Tesla lithium-ion battery energy storage system in a research demonstration with Southern Company R&D and EPRI. The integration of cost effective energy storage with intermittent renewable generation is one of the key options that can help lower carbon emissions."}]}}

In the US, approximately 47% of EY's US net leased space, were in LEED-certified buildings in FY18. In addition, six EY offices have received LEED certification for Commercial Interiors. We have invested millions of dollars in the EY@Work projects, which focus on continually decreasing the space used by each of our people. In FY18, we successfully implemented 17 additional EY@Work projects. The EY@Work offices provide a number of different types of workplaces responding to the ways in which our people operate today, many of whom are frequently working outside their assigned offices. In addition, we selected a brand new building in the Seattle, US office that is built to stringent sustainability standards. In Canada, offices in Calgary, Toronto and Montreal are LEED Platinum, and offices in Edmonton, Halifax and Waterloo are LEED Gold certified. The remaining offices in Saskatoon and Vancouver will shortly all be in state-of-the-art LEED buildings by FY20 and FY23, respectively. In addition, the Canada Waterloo office became carbon neutral in FY19."}]}}

Each generation of process technology enables us to build products that offer higher performance and improved energy efficiency compared to previous generations. Over the last decade, we have significantly improved energy efficiency in our products (8.5x for data center products and 14x for notebooks). Intel continued to work on energy-efficiency initiatives in 2019. One example is the implementation of the always-connected Modern Standby state to replace traditional system sleep and idle states. This transition has already started in the notebook PC segment, and we expect approximately 40% of Intel technology-based notebook computers to adopt Modern Standby by end of 2020, resulting in a 5% energy consumption reduction versus systems with traditional sleep modes. A similar transition in desktop PCs will start shipping on customer systems in 2021. Platform power savings are achieved through power management policies to power down platform components into the lowest power state when the system is idle. Continued improvement in product energy efficiency is a key priority in our 2030 goals."}]}}

(Medium-term, Long-term, Short-term)\n\nAnswer: Oracle's Risk Management and Resiliency Program (RMRP) and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) teams assess the severity and scale of acute physical risks (e.g. hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, etc.) and formulate contingency plans accordingly on an annual basis. The RMRP process includes a planning, documenting, and testing cycle that assesses Oracle's resilience in response to physical risks, including climate-related natural disasters. Oracle's RMRP Program Management Office publishes a formal Risk Assessment template that provides for the identification and characterization of environmental and climate-related risks. For example, Oracle's RMRP team took several steps to proactively address the risks posed by Hurricanes Dorian, Humberto and Lorenzo in 2019. This included actively communicating with employees and preparing to re-route critical business operations to alternative offices.Storm damages poses a significant risk to Oracle, as the third highest financial risk. Unlike the two other top risks which are chronic, and therefore increase more drastically over time, storm damage presents a consistent steady increase in impact between 2020 and 2040. The Oracle Global Customer Support (GCS) Call Center HQ is most impacted by storm damage from Hurricane risk in particular."}]}}

To achieve that we have focused on addressing unmet needs that disproportionately impact underserved populations in low resource settings. Through an end-to-end approach from R&D to delivery we are advancing products (medicines, vaccines) and solutions that we aim to make available, accessible and affordable. According to the 2015 The Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change, the impacts of climate change threaten to undermine decades worth of progress in healthcare. Shifting weather patterns, changes in air quality and spread of vector-borne diseases pose significant risks for people's health and well-being, particularly in resource-limited settings (Africa, Latin America and Asia where they have the potential to spread more quickly). We anticipate that climate change could impact the progress we have made in global health in many ways, whether through air pollution, how infectious diseases emerge and spread (including Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), and pandemic threats such as Ebola, and Zika), or shifting weather patterns impacting allergies. Given its far-reaching implications and associated public health costs, combating climate change could be the greatest opportunity to improve human health. Emerging shifts in global disease profiles can be expected to require new products and services to help increase human resilience to disease. To aid in our ambition to achieve a World Without Disease, we are therefore invested in R&D and/or partnerships in critical areas such as vector-borne and zoonotic diseases with pandemic potential (such as Ebola, Zika, Dengue, Chagas Disease, Malaria etc.), tuberculosis, and air pollution."}]}}

Facility-level risks are documented as part of Business Continuity Plans, managed at the facility level and monitored at a corporate level. Enterprise Risk Management, is responsible for the implementation of consistent and effective processes for risk identification, monitoring and mitigation, and event management related to employee and environmental protection, facilities and assets, products, compliance, reputation and communications as well as integration with existing business functions. Risk management is integrated into processes including strategic planning, brand planning, performance management, disclosure, and crisis management, including disruption in supply chain continuity including from natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism. Certain acute physical risks such as flooding are also evaluated at each manufacturing and R&D facility, as part of comprehensive multi-year global water source and wastewater risk assessments. Since the project's inception, 100% or 13 of 13 manufacturing and R&D sites have been evaluated for water source and wastewater risk. As an example of a relevant risk, our manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico sustained impacts to the facilities as a result of Hurricane Maria. Informed by our recent risk assessment results and business strategy, BMS is pursuing a detailed feasibility study for an LNG fueled CHP driven microgrid project at one of our sites in Puerto Rico, in partnership with two other industrial companies on the island. Results of the study are ongoing."}]}}

Only 99% of emissions are covered because the intensity goal only applies to jet fuel (covered both in Scope 1 and 3). The other 1% is ground support equipment, electricity, chemicals, natural gas, etc. and is not part of this intensity goal. Delta's intensity target aligns with IATA's short-term climate change goal: improve fuel efficiency by 1.5% per year between 2009 and 2020. The metric to calculate this is how much fuel it takes (gallons) to transport passengers a certain distance (revenue ton miles). While we typically report in gallons per 100 RTM internally (100 just so it is not a decimal), it has been converted to metric tons per 100 RTM for reporting here. The IATA goal is expressed as an intensity efficiency goal to allow for growth of the airline while new technology aircraft and biofuel at commercial scale is still being developed. This means an airlines fuel consumption (emissions) can grow year over year (attributed to growing the business and flying more weight or miles), as long as the fuel growth is less than the business growth. Delta's efficiency has improved 9.16% since 2009, an average of 1.02% per year which is below the IATA goal. However, for the last 2 years, Delta has seen a 2.21% and 1.23% improvement in efficiency, in large part due to new aircraft, which provides the most fuel savings by far. Delta grew in terms of revenue ton miles (weight of revenue times the distance it flew) for the 2018 year, total fuel consumption (Scope 1 and Scope 3, Delta mainline and DCI) increased by 3.2%, while fuel consumption only increased by 2%, thus the fuel efficiency improvement of 1.23%."}]}}

Raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins. We use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of our products. The prices for these raw materials are cyclical and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical- based raw materials and energy could increase our costs. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We also have some sole-source suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials in the future. These factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers, which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers. Sealed Air has a reputation for innovation and for timely supply of materials as needed by customers. Delays could seriously damage our reputation. In addition, if our reputation is put at risk through decreased visibility in sustainability or damage to our company brand due to climate change related interruptions; our ability to continue business with our customers could decrease. Changes in market trends are analyzed by global market intelligence staff and reported to the Global Sustainability Action Team and business marketing professionals. Changes in delivery/customer service are monitored by regional business units at monthly Regional Business Reviews and sub-teams formed on an as needed basis."}]}}

Nearly all of our hotels in Hawaii have solar photovoltaic systems to generate onsite energy either in place or in development. We have also invested in onsite co-generation and steam-to-gas conversion systems at hotels in the New York market.We enter into forward purchase agreements to hedge against cost increases in fuel, energy and commodities. Currently, we hedge up to 50% of our exposure to energy costs. Using our ISO 14001 certified EMS, we evaluate the entire consolidated portfolio on a quarterly basis to identify energy reduction opportunities and investment in capital expenditures to increase energy efficiency within our portfolio.In 2018, we continued to partner with our brands to support them in reducing food waste, which is economically inefficient and also a significant part of their waste streams. For example, Marriott has set a public goal to reduce food waste by 50% from 2016-2025. We also continue to work with our EPA SmartWay\u00ae\ufe0f logistics providers and suppliers to optimize sourcing and distribution of products such as case goods, to manage risks associated with increased shipping costs. We have estimated past shipping cost savings of nearly 40% through this program.These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risk's potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years."}]}}

Compliance with these laws and regulations can increase cost, affect our strategy, and constrain our ability to adequately price our products. Our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled, licensed or authorized to conduct business. State regulations generally seek to protect the interests of policyholders rather than an insurer or the insurer's shareholders and other investors. U.S. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things, licensing and authorizing lines of business, approving policy forms and premium rates, setting statutory capital and reserve requirements, limiting the types and amounts of certain investments and restricting underwriting practices. State insurance departments also set constraints on domestic insurer transactions with affiliates and dividends and, in many cases, must approve affiliate transactions and extraordinary dividends as well as strategic transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures."}]}}

PG&E is one of the largest combined natural gas and electric utilities in the United States. Based in San Francisco, with approximately 23,000 employees, PG&E delivers some of the nation's cleanest energy to nearly 16 million Californians. PG&E Corporation had over $85 billion in assets as of December 31, 2019, and generated revenues of more than $17 billion in 2019.PG&E has emerged from Chapter 11, successfully completing the restructuring process and implementing PG&E's Plan of Reorganization that was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on June 20, 2020. As part of our Plan of Reorganization, PG&E made a series of commitments, including assuming all power purchase agreements as part of a broader commitment to California's clean energy future.Our climate continues to change: in less than a decade, the area served by PG&E that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has designated to be at a high risk of wildfire has increased from 15 to 52%--an increase of more than 300%. Our Community Wildfire Safety Program includes immediate and comprehensive actions to upgrade our infrastructure, monitor fire threats in real time and institute new wildfire safety measures.Despite these challenges, PG&E continues to take action to combat climate change and support California's climate goals. Doing so is integral to our ongoing efforts to provide safe, reliable, affordable, and clean energy to customers. We remain focused on reducing our carbon footprint, advancing low-carbon policies for California and the nation, helping customers reduce their energy use with industry-leading tools and incentives, and addressing the need to adapt to changing climate conditions.Within our operations, PG&E is reducing emissions as part of the ''Million Ton Challenge\" -- a voluntary five-year carbon reduction goal to avoid one million tons of greenhouse gases from our operations by 2022. To accomplish this, PG&E is working to reduce methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions from operations, save energy in facilities, and continue to deploy a smarter, cleaner fleet of company vehicles.At the state and federal level, PG&E supports the decarbonization of California's economy through timely, durable, effective and affordable policy and energy solutions. We remain committed to climate actions to reduce greenhouse gases and address the impacts of climate change--from deploying clean energy technologies to continuing to lead and innovate on energy efficiency. PG&E is committed to helping the state meet its long-term targets of a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2045 in a manner that is affordable for our customers.In 2019, PG&E delivered nearly 30% of its energy from renewable resources and we remain on track to meet the state's 60% by 2030 mandate under SB 100.We also continue to offer our customers a full portfolio of programs and incentives for energy efficiency, demand response, clean energy transportation and solar energy to help them meet their clean energy goals. In 2019, we brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to nearly 465,000 and we supported over 8,000 customers who have installed battery storage at their homes or businesses, often paired with a solar system.PG&E is also actively supporting the large-scale electric infrastructure needed to incorporate EV charging systems into the energy grid.

With 80% of our leases up for renewal in the next 4 years, we have a significant opportunity to leverage green leases for offices/buildings which have LEED or similar certifications and will help lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Typically, these lease costs are higher, but we expect operating costs to decline as a result of energy efficiency measures. Operational excellence through energy efficiency is the core of our short- and long-term energy strategy. We also prioritize the purchase of clean energy locally where possible and for buildings where we have operational control. A sample of annual energy efficiency projects implemented to date include: sensor technology, LED lighting, sub-metering, and demand-response software. Projects implemented to date have average return on investments (ROIs) of less than 3 years, and these projects have cumulatively helped save more than US $1.7 million in operating expenses since we began tracking. We anticipate similar savings as well as a reduction in Scope 2 GHG emissions going forward with continued investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy and green leases."}]}}

Also monitoring water usage and recycling programs for e-waste and paper.Green Delivery - We apply green principles to software development by reducing effort per function point, increasing the reusability of our code and improving efficiencies and quality. These are measured through tools built in-house.* InsightLive is a code governance tool that helps to reduce software development effort and associated resource and energy usage through increased reusability and good governance. * Accello, our RPA tool, helps to reduce cycle time and energy use. For example, use of Accello for Virtusa's service desk helped to avoid 12.<PHONE> MT CO2eq of emissions. * Virtusa Test Automation Framework helps to reduce software testing effort and associated energy costs. Green Tech - Through Green Tech, we explore opportunities of using best in class technologies, tools and design architecture including virtualization, optimization, etc. that increase efficiencies and reduce resource consumption, resulting in a decrease of emissions when these products and services are implemented and used."}]}}

By reviewing the planned development the company identifies risks and opportunities to mitigate those risks. Given ARC through its Carbon and Emission Management Plan identified its largest source of Scope 1 emissions to be from combustion, it also presents a financial risk in the way of Carbon Levies which are applied combusted fuels. ARC has identified electrification as the greatest measure to reduce combustion and carbon levy impacts. As well it provides the opportunity to enter offset markets for the reduction in carbon emissions, furthering the economic sustainability of implementing emission reductions. Additionally, in locations where electricity for a facility is not accessible ARC will employ energy saving alternatives such as Waste Heat Recovery as seen at our Dawson 3 Gas Plant. The technology capture heat from turbines used to generate power for the infrastructure on site and then disperse the heat energy as needed for process hydrocarbon products. The technology replaces the need for combustion and reduces emissions by approximately 30,000 tCO2e/yr as opposed to conventional design."}]}}

WBA follows emerging regulations at the international, federal, state, city and local levels to understand the possible future implications for the Company's costs and ability to operate. For example, the European Union (EU) Strategy on Sustainable and Smart Mobility is expected to be published in the fourth quarter of 2020. Transport accounts for a quarter of the EU's GHG emissions. To support the deployment of zero- and low-emission vehicles the EU Commission plans to adapt the existing legislation such as: the 2014 Alternative fuels infrastructure directive and the 2013 Trans-European transport network regulation. This will likely have an impact on WBA's fleet vehicle operations across the EU."}]}}

We engaged both clients and NGOs on issues related to GHG emissions and climate change strategies through meetings, external networking, grant making and annual surveys. We share best practices and discuss ideas on how to better partner on an ongoing basis. For example, in November 2019, we held a meeting with some of our largest corporate clients to discuss low carbon product and initiatives. In 2019, we've also engaged with NGOs providing over $2.8 million in support of the environment and wildlife through our Gift Matching and Serve2Gether grant programs. We also have been supporting The Nature Conservancy Plant a Billion program since 2017.Our strategy for prioritization of our clients is determined by revenue generation and the maturity of their sustainability programs. We usually prioritize partnership with clients who have more progressive sustainability strategy. We prioritize engagement with NGOs based on their community impact and by ensuring their projects align with our giving strategy.Success is measured by the number of clients and NGOS that have been engaged on this topic. Over 100 corporate large clients participated in a session to discuss sustainability and business travel. We also continually try to engage with more of our supply chain on sustainability issues and clients as feasible. We continue to view increased engagement as an indicator of our CSR and sustainability programs."}]}}

The Company has met the previous three voluntary GHG reduction targets set. The Scope 3 emissions of business travel and employee commuting are covered in the current target, as well as the previous three targets. The Hartford is not eligible for setting a science based target based on the fact that it qualifies as a financial institution, but our targets are intended to satisfy the science-based target criteria. The Hartford reduced its GHGe by 6.7% in 2019, achieving our medium-term goal and remaining on track to reach our long-term goal. Through year 4 of our new medium and long-term targets, emissions have been reduced by 27.6 percent compared with the 2015 target base year. Therefore, the percent complete for the long-term target is (27.6/46.2)*100 = 59.7 percent. Note: In alignment with the recommended approach of the Science Based Target Initiative, The Hartford's baseline and subsequent data was adjusted to incorporate GHGe impacts resulting from the acquisition of Navigators business in 2019. The Hartford shared the new GHGe goals when successfully applying for two Climate Leadership Awards in 2018 for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management, Goal Setting and Goal Achievement; The Hartford was announced as a winner of both awards in early 2019.Note: The Hartford's Scope 3 emissions included in 2019 data are those generated from employee commuting and business travel. A comprehensive review of the company's scope 3 emissions is currently underway."}]}}

The first rule is the mechanism that establishes New Jersey's initial cap on GHG emissions of 18 million tons in 2020. The final rule follows the RGGI model rule with a cap that will decline three percent annually through 2030 to a final cap of 11.5 million tons. New Jersey is committed to a start date of January 1, 2020. The second rule establishes the framework for how New Jersey will spend the RGGI auction proceeds\". (PSEG 2018 10K p.21)"}]}}

Location emissions are calculated using country or regional emission factors from those published by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (eGRID), the United Kingdom's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the International Energy Agency, among others. Deloitte Global refreshes its emission factors database each year to reflect updates to these published emission factors. Electricity usage is captured from utility bills, obtained from the landlord, or estimated. District heating and cooling are excluded from Deloitte reporting as previous analysis across several years showed these emission sources were not material to Deloitte's overall GHG footprint. Market-based emissions will evolve as the process continues to mature."}]}}

Over 80% of what we place onto the market is purchased from others, so we recognize the need to work with our suppliers to measure, plan and reduce our environmental footprint. Some of our suppliers are already using CDP as a data management tool and SBD has now been using CDP Supply Chain to work with its suppliers for two years to determine risk in our supply chain. We recognize the risk of not knowing exactly what our scope 3 environmental footprint is, so we set a goal to complete CDP Supply Chain Climate Change assessments for 80% of our supplier spend by 2020. In addition, SBD committed to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions 35% by 2030, using a 2017 base year by sourcing raw materials, finished goods, components and services from suppliers that meet environmental and social sustainability criteria."}]}}

Stakeholder interests are an important part of ARC's decision making process and are always considered in risk assessments.For example, while none of ARC's operational assets are within First Nations, a portion lies within the traditional territory occupied by both Treaty 6 & Treaty 8 Indigenous Peoples and by the Metis people and as a result, ARC engages with Indigenous communities throughout the lifecycle of development activities. ARC supports the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call to action to corporations to adopt the UNDRIP as a framework for reconciliation.

Creating long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers is integral to 7G. It is important for 7G to work with like-minded suppliers who recognize the value of sustainable development. 7G endeavours to work with suppliers who are willing to help the company find innovative solutions to help reduce its carbon footprint. From the onset of its engagement with suppliers, 7G is clear about its goal to be among the lowest greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity natural gas producers in its peer group. This is part of the evaluation and selection criteria for suppliers. The RFP process and the selection criteria for suppliers includes sustainable development considerations. For example, 7G prefers to engage with hydraulic fracturing suppliers that use bi-fuel pumps instead of diesel engines and drilling rigs that operate on bi-fuel. Having bi-fuel capable equipment enables 7G's service providers to use 7G-produced natural gas, which saves money and reduces air emissions compared to diesel engines. 7G is also working with a supplier that uses its global positioning system to monitor unnecessary fuel consumption such as excessive idling. The Construction team also looks at truck cycle times and ensures that the right size vehicle is used to haul supplies. Beyond the RFP and selection process, 7G finds opportunities to engage suppliers by fostering innovation and seeking opportunities for collaboration."}]}}

Our strategy is to quantify benefits related to each customers' goals, called ''sustainability value analysis\". We consider the entire value chain including shelf life extension & packaging robust enough to withstand the rigors of export or optimized for e-commerce. The sustainability group works with subject matter experts & customers to collect cost & benefit data. We conduct Sustainability Value Analysis to help explain the benefits to existing & new customers. The results help validate customer & retailer climate related GHG emissions reductions. Our strategy is to use data-based analysis to demonstrate how Sealed Air solutions reduce GHG emissions throughout the supply chain. In 2017 we worked with a retailer to switch packaging that saved 8 million kg CO2e from transportation, refrigeration & reduction of meat and seafood waste. As climate-change increases the costs of limited resources to produce food & consumer/industrial products, customers place higher value on protecting those products from food waste or product damage through the entire supply chain. Reduction of waste always reduces GHG emissions from production, transportation, storage, replacement and disposal. Analysis of product benefits is a normal cost of doing business."}]}}

Our Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) also meets intermittently with individual members of the PPCRC to discuss any sustainability topics of interest to that member. The PPCRC has 4 members, including a chairperson. The PPCRC is briefed by the SVP of CSR, who is also our CSO, on climate-related issues as they relate to overall strategy and provides input/guidance in the development of our strategy. The PPCRC's Charter outlines the Committee's responsibilities related to public policy and specifically cites its authority over corporate policies and practices in furtherance of our CSR activities, including environmental policies. Programmatic operations for climate change-related activities fall under CSR at AT&T, therefore the PPCRC is ultimately responsible for our climate change strategy. An example of a climate related decision made by the PPCRC was to review and approve AT&T's development of our Climate Change Analysis Tool (CCAT). The CCAT combines mapping software with climate data and enables AT&T to assess the long-term infrastructure and operational impacts of climate related severe weather events, such as flooding and high intensity winds."}]}}

To reduce our dependence on brown power, we have implemented solar arrays on 7 of our facilities. To monitor our energy usage, we implemented an online sustainability platform that enables us to see our entire energy and cost footprint. We also have an energy management software for monitoring our refrigeration systems. To increase our operational excellence, we regularly implement Green Building practices (the latest of which is our Ridgefield, WA facility expansion, projected to reduce energy usage by 54%) and evaluate projects with energy benefits as part of normal capital investment processes. Case study: We have implemented projects over the past 3 years (fleet improvements; on-site solar arrays; LED installations in distribution centers, etc.) that have contributed, in addition to other sustainability initiatives, to approximately $4 million in annual savings. While our management method is not currently linked to an emissions target, in 2020, we will revisit setting an emissions reduction target that includes our expanded footprint and is in line with the latest climate science which limits global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius.How cost of response was calculated: The cost of management incorporates an average of capital projects from 2016 - 2019 and projects in the pipeline that increase our efficiency and lower our energy costs. This is a representative annual cost but may vary from year to year."}]}}

In the face of increased regulatory pressures in the form of stricter air pollution limits and relatively low-cost natural gas, coal fired generation is likely to continue to decrease in the future. Union Pacific's revenue from coal shipments increased by 2% in 2018 compared to 2017. The percentage of U.S. electricity generation from coal has declined from around 38.5% in 2014 to roughly 27% in 2018, while 35% was generated from natural gas and 17% from renewables in 2018. UP monitors these statistics and expects that there will be continued headwinds for this commodity. As part of UP's enterprise risk management, UP monitors current regulations that may impact its customers and UP and evaluates how it can mitigate for those potential impacts. Current regulations that cause electric generation to move to fuels that are not tied to climate-related risks could impact Union Pacific's business due to decreased demand for existing services with a resulting decrease in coal shipments. UP monitors current regulations, their impact on customers and UP, and potential mitigation at a management level through the Environmental Management Group, the Law department, Marketing and Sales and at the Board level through reporting by Management and evaluation by the Audit Committee."}]}}

Our Risk Assessment process for current regulatory risks is consistent with our overall risk management framework: corporate and brand cross-functional teams collaborate to identify, study, and rank new and/or emerging risks. Once risks are identified, teams will develop mitigation plans. These risk assessments are then included in strategic business reviews as well as Compliance Oversight Committee and Audit Committee meetings as appropriate. One example of a current regulatory risk is increased regulation around packaging. To proactively address and account for such regulatory risks, Yum! Brands has established increased focus teams to address solutions that are currently available and proactively develop new solutions. For example, we recently replaced plastic straws and provided more environmentally-friendly alternatives in our Taiwanese restaurants in response to the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency's planned ban on the use of single-use plastic drinking straws. We have also joined the Next Gen Consortium to help advance food-service packaging solutions that are recoverable. These actions will hopefully ensure continued regulatory compliance, a reduction of climate-related risks, and reduced emissions in the long-term."}]}}

In researching the optimal lighting specification, Ryder determined that the energy efficiency of the metal halide declines by 30% after the 1st year of operation and continues to decline over the life of the lamp. This loss in energy efficiency results in reduced lumens and lower light levels. LED lights last 5 times as long as fluorescent lights and use at least 75% less energy than incandescent lighting and have an approximately 40% longer lifetime than fluorescent lights. LED lamps do not contain mercury, which is an added benefit in environmental impacts. Therefore, Ryder's customers, shareholders, and employees all benefit from initiatives that produce significant reductions in energy consumption and therein reduced scope 2 GHG emissions."}]}}

Praxair is at the beginning of many value chains (for carbonated beverage companies, refineries, electronics, aerospace, automotive, healthcare, steel making, etc.). Praxair provides many intermediate products with many downstream applications, each of which has a very different GHG profile. The effort involved in determining Scope 3 emissions from use of our products is not reasonable, and for this reason, we are unable to reasonably estimate the downstream emissions associated with the various end uses of our products. For these reasons, we do not report emissions in the following categories: processing of sold products, use of sold products, and end of life treatment of sold products. As noted in CC3.2a, the use of a number of our products/applications helps customers reduce their GHG emissions, i.e., the use of our products does not generate emissions but helps others reduce theirs. Emissions from our CO2 sales to the food industry may be traceable. This market segment is a subset of our food and beverage end market, which is 9% of our annual revenue. Actual CO2 volumes are business confidential. However, customers have requested this information as part of CDP's Supply Chain program and we have provided it to them."}]}}

For U.S. raw fluid milk, our dairy partners deploy the National Milk Producers Federation's Farmers Assuring Responsible Management (FARM) Environmental Stewardship module (formerly called FarmSmart) to measure and track farm sustainability. The data is evaluated against key environmental indicators to establish a natural resource efficiency baseline for each grower. We then hold workshops and collaborate with local, trusted agronomists and other experts to identify and implement continuous improvement practices.Progress: During fiscal 2018, we continued to elevate sustainability as central to our global sourcing strategy. We launched engagements in new regions and brought on new supplier partners to advance progress. Since 2010, we have worked with more than 275 growers to collect data on a cumulative total of over 1,311,000 acres."}]}}

Converting from cast iron piping to plastic can reduce methane emissions by 95%. All three utilities are long time members of the EPA's Natural Gas Star program and in April 2016 committed to the Methane Reduction Challenge - establishing a goal to replace cast iron mains in the system at a minimum rate of 2% per year through 2021. Performance against this goal has continued to be strong, with 87 miles of cast iron main (over 3%) in 2017. This effort is counted as 3 projects implemented (relating one each to BGE, Delmarva and PECO), with a similar 3 projects to be implemented in 2018, under question 4.3a. Emissions, investment and cost savings which are provided are related to the 2017 pipe cast iron and unprotected steel pipe replacement projects implemented at BGE, Delmarva and PECO combined.

Approximately 30% of Goodyear's products are sold as original equipment for new vehicles. If Goodyear is able to efficiently and quickly respond to changes in market demands, we can potentially increase sales volumes to key customers. Goodyear's overall R&D expenditures in 2017 totaled $406 million, an increase of approximately 20% since 2009. While Goodyear's R&D focuses on a variety of product and technology improvements, a portion of these expenditures is dedicated to projects directly related to improving the fuel efficiency and developing other attributes (e.g. wet grip, noise, tread life) of our tires."}]}}

The main scope of the program in 2019 was to implement the PaCT Assessment and Solar pre-feasibility study in South Asia laundries and mills. As part of this program, LS&Co. is also covering the costs for eligible suppliers to undergo a renewable energy assessment. For suppliers for whom onsite renewable investment is feasible, LS&Co. will collaborate with the IFC on a financing model. As a starting point, we will leverage the IFC Global Trade Supplier Finance program, in which LS&Co. has been involved since 2014. This program enables suppliers to access competitively-priced financing based on criteria such as strong performance on our Terms of Engagement (LS&Co.'s supplier code of conduct). It provides access to capital for sustainability investments, which the supplier may otherwise not have been able to finance. In 2017, participating suppliers reduced their GHG emissions and energy use by an average of 13 percent and 22 percent, respectively. In addition to reducing their GHG footprint, these initiatives helped participating suppliers save more than $1 million in operating costs in total. We hope to see up to 70% of actions recommended by the program adopted by our PaCT vendors. Given these promising results, our plan is to expand the PaCT program to more factories and to fabric mills, which have a larger GHG footprint than our contract manufacturing facilities. Measures of success include: number and type of suppliers participating in PaCT, amount of energy reduced, amount of GHG emissions avoided, amount of cost savings, number of recommended actions implemented, number of countries covered through PaCT engagement, number of United Nation Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) supported by PaCT."}]}}

Within the Climate Risk Assessment framework, our Engineering, Asset Management and Sustainable Operations and Community Engagement/CSR groups, with information provided from NGO partners (WRI, Ceres, etc.), lobbyists, and regulatory body relationships, undertake ongoing monitoring of municipal, state and federal regulations. The significance of current regulations is assessed against likelihood, enterprise/asset impact and their significance to our attainment of strategic goals. Should an identified risk/opportunity pose a substantive financial ($50k for the organization) or operational (occurring at more than 1 site) impact, these groups would inform appropriate groups (C-level, G&CR Committee, etc.) and assess strategic mitigation options. For example, Caesars decision to function as an unbundled customer in the state of Nevada requires the company to adhere to the Nevada state RPS standard, which requires Caesars to meet at least 20% of electricity procurement from renewable sources (growing to 50%). The Sustainable Operations group identified this risk during our Climate Risk Assessments and reacted accordingly by working with executives and board members to prioritize the risk and ensure we acquired the necessary amount of compliance instruments to meet or exceed the Nevada RPS standard."}]}}

This progress will be despite new equipment coming online due to business growth expected in 2018. Emissions sources covered by this goal include all building and support equipment electricity uses, emergency and auxiliary stationary combustion sources, fleet vehicles, natural gas distribution systems, SF6 electrical insulated equipment, and refrigerant sources. Emissions not included in this goal are those we own, but do not have direct control over how they operate. These emission sources include our Scope 1 emissions from electric generation since the level of operation for these units is determined by grid demand for electricity and resulting plant dispatch as determined by the grid balancing authority (outside of our operational control since we have a commitment to the grid to be available as needed to meet demand); and Scope 2 emissions associated with transmission and distribution line losses since these emissions are primarily driven by the volume of electricity required to be delivered to utility customers (similarly outside of our day-to-day operational control since we have a commitment to the public utility commissions to deliver power as needed). It should be note, that for these other sources, Exelon does maintain performance management indicators (lbs/MWh generated and % loss of MWh delivered) to ensure a continued focus on GHG emissions and to capture the impacts of the GHG emission reduction efforts being implemented. Looking across these three areas, Exelon ensures ongoing management of emissions across 100% of our GHG inventory."}]}}

To track progress and identify areas for improvement, we require (require production and encourage non-production) our suppliers to disclose corporate-wide GHG emissions annually through the CDP supply chain program, set goals, and improve the accuracy of their GHG emissions accounting. Clear description of measures of successOur measurement for success is determined by tracking the percentage of suppliers reporting to HPE in each category and reductions in emissions. Our goal is to have 95% of production supplier spend reporting GHG emissions annually. In 2017, HPE collected GHG emissions and other environmental-related information from 35 of our production suppliers for the 2016 reporting year (the latest year for which data is available). These suppliers represented 95% of our first tier production suppliers by spend. We also obtained information from 32 of our first tier nonproduction suppliers for the 2016 reporting year. These suppliers represented 31% of our first tier nonproduction suppliers by spend. Nonproduction suppliers are those that do not provide materials, components or transport for our products, such as travel vendors, telecommunication firms, and staffing companies.HPE believes that encouraging its suppliers to set challenging targets and build their own internal sustainability capabilities will have a positive ripple effect upstream through the supply chain, beyond its direct suppliers. And when customers use HPE's energy efficient technology, manufactured in factories with science-based targets, they will cut downstream emissions, achieving more with less environmental impact."}]}}

For example, risk is present with safety, manufacturing and environmental compliance. Risk is also present with strategies, markets, products and customers. For risk oversight, International Paper has a governance system in place where the Board of Directors and Senior Management use a system of councils to manage risk by identifying, understanding and taking action to mitigate risk. At an operational (asset) level, International Paper management is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations including the identification, understanding and mitigation of risks. At a foundation level, International Paper uses a system of policies, procedures and controls to manage risk across the company. These policies, procedures and controls cover all aspects of the company operations. For example, the company has specific rules for safety, manufacturing and environmental compliance as well as specific rules for legal and financial compliance. In addition, the company uses the COSO and COBIT framework for internal controls over financial reporting and IT systems. These low level systems of control help to manage risk.

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: Water management is an essential part of our operations and is a method we implement to address the risks associated with groundwater mandates, such as the SGMA. For example, we treat and re-use water co-produced with oil and natural gas for vital activities. We also provide treated, reclaimed water to agricultural water districts while also using supplied water from various local and regional sources in our power plants and in support of operations. Through these investments, we have served for years as a net water supplier to agriculture. In 2019, CRC supplied 5.35 billion gallons of treated, reclaimed water to agricultural water districts, doubling our 2015 deliveries. This volume to agriculture set a company record and exceeded the volume of fresh water purchased for our operations statewide.While most water for our operations is recycled water, we have invested in additional water treatment and recycling facilities to ensure our freshwater use does not affect the availability of water to local communities near our operations. For example, CRC already recycles 64 percent of our produced water at Elk Hills for pressure maintenance and waterflood projects to recover additional oil in place, up from zero percent when the U.S. Government operated the field. in 2019, CRC began designing an expansion of our water recycling at Elk Hills to recycle and transport an additional 5.5 million bbls per year for pressure maintenance and waterflood use and to prepare certain oil and gas formations for carbon capture and sequestration. The cost of response is based on the costs for 2.5 full-time employees ($500,000) and the resources needed by our water management team to design and permit the water recycling expansion and pipeline project to reduce produced water disposal, maximize its reuse as our primary water source, and further reduce our use of fresh water resources ($300,000)."}]}}

We develop product footprints that provide a clear picture of the areas of greatest impact from which we develop action plans to address and mitigate identified impacts. We work with the Publicly Available Standard, PAS2050 and the ISO standards 14040, 14044, 14067, and 14064, on life cycle assessment (LCA), product carbon footprints, and product GHG reductions. We apply our knowledge of LCA and these standards to provide a verifiable carbon footprint which can be used to obtain a verifiable carbon label for products so that consumers are aware of the choices they are making. In 2017, we conducted a whole building LCA on the new construction of two light rail stations in San Francisco International Airport to gain additional LEEDv4 points. We used the Tally\u00ae\ufe0f tool in Revit to streamline the WBLCA process in the schematic design, design development, and construction documentation phases. Also, WSP is an organizational member of the American Center for Life Cycle Assessment (ACLCA) and a WSP employee serves on the board and the education committee. Costs associated with managing climate change risks driven by reduced demand for our services involve normal costs associated with the firm's operations (i.e. research, employee compensation, recruiting, software, etc.) There are no additional costs to the business."}]}}

Data inputs and emissions data outputs (64686 MT CO2e) pertain to News Corporation's 2016 fiscal year.Emissions for business air travel were made separately using EPA passenger mile emissions factors and flight data gathered from News Corp's corporate travel management system and from individual business units that book travel not through the corporate travel agent. Each flight leg was assigned the appropriate emission factor based on the distance of the flight. Business travel flight data were provided by flight leg and then categorized by short (0-300 miles), medium (<PHONE> miles) and long haul (>2300 miles) flight legs. The short, medium and long haul emissions factors were applied respectively to each flight leg to calculate emissions from News Corp's employee business travel. However, results from the Evaluator tool were shown to be more conservation-as representing all modes of business travel beyond air-and thus was chosen to be reported here."}]}}

These include, for example, providing carbon inventory data, publishing a GRI-based sustainability report, publishing GHG emissions reductions goal, and demonstrating GHG emissions reductions through participation in an HP-led environmental capability building program. Also, HP's key commodity suppliers' sustainability scores act as a multiplier to their general supplier management scores. This allows suppliers with strong sustainability performance greater opportunities for new or expanded business with HP, while suppliers with persistently low sustainability performance will have much lower overall scores and may see large reductions in our business. The impact of our campaign to educate suppliers and build their capabilities to address climate change is seen and measured through supplier participation in the program, the number of projects implemented and the resulting reductions in costs and emissions.Measure of success: Suppliers engaged in HP's Sustainability Scorecard process show consistent performance improvements. In 2018, the average score increased by more than 12% compared to 2016.Supplier engaged HP-led capability building programs have also demonstrated notable success. Since 2010, participants in our programs have saved a cumulative $98 million in costs through reductions in electricity consumed and avoided over one million tonnes of CO2e emissions through 2018."}]}}

These costs include complying with regulations and other industry-led standards, such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. Artesyn views costs that enhance Artesyn's reputation as an opportunity to beat out competitors who may not have effective compliance programs or other methods to minimize reputation risk. For example, facility SER (social and environmental responsibility) audits, which include environmental measures such as carbon emissions, are $10k USD on average per facility each site has full time personnel dedicated to environmental compliance as well as product quality and product efficiency design. The cost to realize opportunity estimation was arrived at by taking the percentage of the R&D budged dedicated to high efficiency product lines in our embedded power line of business."}]}}

NGOs campaigns can impact companies' reputation and have business consequences on license to operate and bottom line.PMI is committed to combat climate change and set actions to act upon it. Those actions are conducive to substantiate PMI's leadership in sustainability as integral part of the success of its business transformation.Thus climate-related reputational risk is included into PMI's risk assessments considering the potential risk it could have on the long term success of the company.In 2019, the evaluation of climate change risks, aligned with TCFD recommendations, allowed for the identification of transition risks related to the reputation of PMI as a sustainability leader in the area of climate change; this evaluation included a survey of opinions of certain PMI stakeholders on how PMI contributed to or detracted from the transition to a lower-carbon economy.PMI identified that reputational risks can be driven by multiple factors including financial performance, investors' priorities, reporting requests, internal workforce concerns around sustainability, and challenges related to raising capital for the agriculture sector as a carbon intensive one.For example, PMI identified failure to address enhanced reporting requests as a potential reputational risk for the company. Increased reporting not only requires additional internal resources, but also exposes the company to a broader stakeholder community and sectoral benchmarking. PMI manages this risk by having an internal reporting team that coordinates reporting initiatives, as well as engagement with external consultants to ensure consistency through multiple reports, transparent communication, effective benchmarking against relevant sustainability ratings and the use of best practice methodologies and standards. We also conduct periodically a sustainability materiality assessment with a broad range of stakeholders. We strengthened our communication through our reporting. Our Integrated Report 2019, which covers our sustainability work, sought to align with the IIRC, GRI and SASB frameworks as well as with the recommendations of the TCFD and requirements of the CDP and other sustainability ratings; those documents and additional content can be consulted in our website."}]}}

Our global cloud service operations are supported by one of the largest physical networks in the world, with several industry certifications including ISO/IEC 27001:2005 and SAS70 Type II. We use geo-replicated customer workloads (keeping multiple copies of workloads in multiple locations) to improve reliability. We have more than 2,000 people working on cloud infrastructure and more than 30,000 software engineers involved in cloud-based activities. To support our cloud services, we are designing our datacenters to be more efficient. A LinkedIn datacenter in Oregon features efficiency innovations that enable it to operate at a PUE of 1.18, thereby minimizing energy use and carbon emissions; the datacenter has earned the Uptime Institute Efficient IT (EIT) Stamp of Approval for the past two years. We have pilot programs with NRG Energy and several battery manufacturers to advance energy storage at our datacenters globally. We continue researching fuel cell systems. We use outside air and adiabatic cooling (which reduces energy costs by ~30 percent) where possible. And our LEED commitment for new datacenter design accrues to our energy efficiency metrics. We are already making these investments, and environmental considerations are already playing a role in customers' decisions to transition to the cloud."}]}}

Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs. We also maintain a global data collection system for our fuel, energy and other utilities. This system allows us to capture copies of all current invoices that include carbon pricing for review and analysis. We also engage with our suppliers to monitor this situation. Fees paid to third party consultants assisting with monitoring and complying with environmental regulations are not specified in our financial reporting, but are not significant. The cost of the environmental impairment liability insurance policy is not reported publicly; however, it is not significant."}]}}

Praxair has identified the need for massive water infrastructure development. For example: Praxair has signed a long-term gas supply contract with Gao Bei Dian Water Recycling Plant of Beijing Drainage Group Co., Ltd. Praxair will build, own and operate a vacuum pressure swing adsorption unit to supply gaseous oxygen to the plant for its wastewater treatment and recycling processes. The plant treats wastewater from municipal drainage and uses the recycled product as cooling water for local power plants as well as for landscaping needs throughout the city. The plant helps to mitigate water shortages and supports the city's sustainable development efforts. To maintain this innovation stream, Praxair R and D developed a target that Praxair's sustainability portfolio should exceed 50% of sales, 2016-2020. In 2017, our sustainability portfolio was 58% of revenue or $6.6 billion. By setting a target for our sustainability portfolio, Praxair is able to increase the likelihood and magnitude of our opportunity to increase demand for products and applications that help companies manage changes in precipitation extremes. We expect these opportunities to materialize within the next 3 years."}]}}

For instance, we track the GHG emissions of our product transportation and distribution vendors, and we collaborate to reduce those impacts while ensuring product integrity. We consider many factors in selecting product packaging, including sustainability aspects such as materials use and recyclability. We require packaging vendors in China, Europe, and the United States to certify that they source all paper and cardboard used to package our products from sustainable forests. We are also committed to understanding the potential effects of pharmaceutical products in the environment. We support using science-based evaluations to assess and reduce the environmental risks of our pharmaceutical products. Through collaborations with industry partners, academic researchers, and regulatory agencies, we continually work to further understand and proactively address any potential impacts from our products. Due to patient safety considerations and medicine regulations, reuse and recycling are not applicable to our products. For our Elanco animal health business, stakeholders are concerned about the interaction between climate change on food production and security. In response, cross-functional teams are actively engaged with key customers and industry groups specifically on food industry sustainability. Elanco endeavors to improve food security and sustainability of the food industry through lifecycle assessment work and collaborative research with organizations like the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef. Elanco is investing in research to improve the efficiency and productivity of protein production while helping to reduce the industry's carbon footprint. Elanco continues to analyze and communicate improved animal productivity as a means to reduce the environmental impact of food animal production and help ensure global food security, which has resulted in formal peer-reviewed scientific studies. We are a member of the Pharmaceutical Product Stewardship Working Group, which is addressing the complexities of properly managing unused and unwanted pharmaceutical products, raises awareness appropriate disposal methods through public awareness campaigns, and develops stewardship plans for local jurisdictions with take-back requirements."}]}}

Drought and/or increased temperatures may change insect pest pressures, requiring growers to use more, less, or different insecticides.The effects of climate change such as rising sea levels, drought, flooding and general volatility in seasonal temperatures could adversely affect our operations globally. Extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in, among other things, physical damage to our property and equipment, and interruptions to our supply chain. Climate change may also impact markets in which we sell our products, where, for example, a prolonged drought may result in decreased demand for our products.The evaluation of this risk is included in the Enterprise Risk Management annual risk assessment process."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: Example of risk typeHPE's greatest source of HPE's GHG emissions is Scope 3, Category 11 Use of sold products which accounts for approximately 60% of HPE's overall carbon footprint. The source of these emissions is the electricity our customers must use in order to power our products. Not surprisingly, the cost associated with the electricity to power IT equipment is a source of concern for our customers. Consequently, any technology company that can save customers energy (and associated cost) while powering their IT needs will be more competitive on the market. If the cost of energy were to increase in order to internalize the climate-related externalities in the market place through a carbon-tax, cap-and-trade system, etc., this could affect the marketability of HPE's products if we are not producing technology with exceptional energy performance. Not only must our products be high performing from energy efficiency, but HPE also acknowledges that in order for our products to be viable in a carbon-constrained world, we must develop new technology that meets the compute demands of the future while working within an energy constrained environment. This climate-related technology risk is driving HPE's investment in technologies such as memory-driven compute and computing at the edge."}]}}

In addition to our efforts listed above in Risk 1, suppliers are required to submit formal RFP responses to the firm, which includes a standard set of environmentally focused prequalification questions designed to assess the management of their specific environmental impacts. The standard set of environmental questions is aligned with the EY Global Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC) and is a standard part of all supplier contracts. All responses are analyzed according to a set of guidelines and scored as part of the overall RFP process. This helps to confirm that our suppliers have a responsible approach to mitigating their environmental impacts and that they will work with us effectively to reduce the related effects of the goods and services they supply. EY Procurement prioritizes working with vendors that are also focused on sustainability within their own business operations and products, which also supports risk management efforts.

Our operations in Alberta will become subject to the fuel charge element of the GGPPA in 2020. Our Canadian suppliers are subject to the GGPPA, indirectly resulting in increased costs for our operations. For 2019, the direct and indirect impact of carbon taxes on the Canadian Business Unit is estimated to be approximately $2.3 MM, with that estimate subject to change based on the timing of enrollment in the Saskatchewan output-based pricing system. For Europe operations, our Carbon Liability Assessment Tool indicates carbon tax is not forecasted to exceed $0.5MM per annum."}]}}

Energy consumption patterns are modeled according to European Commission and U.S. EPA computer eco-design studies that reflect aggressive assumptions on daily product usage. For example, for a computer, the calculation reflects the power consumed in off, sleep, idle and active-modes and the time in each mode of operation, over a four-year use period. The total power is then multiplied by the carbon coefficient appropriate for the geographic region and the number of products sold in that region in a given fiscal year. Carbon coefficients for each geographic region are based on published data and are reviewed by the Fraunhofer Institute on an annual basis to ensure consistency with best business practices. [Calculated in accordance to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. For more detail, refer to our ''Five-Step LCA Process\" in the Further Information section below.]"}]}}

The insurer added that 2018 was not an outlier in terms of natural catastrophes in the past decade and described it as possibly the ''new normal\" for the insurance industry. While difficult to estimate, we have anticipated that changes in temperature in regions where we lease, manage or own real estate have the potential to cause increased electricity and/or natural gas consumption representing an estimated four percent of our total energy cost, based on site specific experiences across our locations during 2018. This equates to approximately $400,000 USD additional operating cost. We expect the magnitude of the financial implications to increase over time with greater extremes in temperature requiring additional energy use and spend."}]}}

Simon has dedicated resources from the corporate property management team to identify portfolio wide efficiency opportunities. One example is Simon partnering with GE's Current to install a variety of solutions from Current's efficient-energy portfolio (including intelligent LEDs, electric vehicle charging stations, and demand response systems) to shift and optimize electricity use. Another example is Simon's work with STEM and AMS on battery storage installations (e.g. at Brea Mall, Del Amo Fashion Center and Ontario Mills). Simon evaluates renewable project developments and monetizes its energy efficiency efforts by offsetting projects to utilities.- Finally, training measures are leveraged to realize this opportunity (i.e., energy efficiency management is embedded in property management training in day-to-day property management practices.) On a local level, mall teams are incentivized to monitor energy use daily and include projects as part of annual budgets."}]}}

The spend pool owner then incorporates this data along with other factors into their ongoing discussions with suppliers. Recent response rates to the survey have been over 85%.In addition to the survey - this year we hosted a two day face-to-face Supplier Sustainability Summit which included over 400+ of our largest global suppliers. P&G executives, including Chief Purchasing Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer, and key global sustainability footprint leaders across P&G personally presented and attended the conference to help re-enforce the key role our supply partners can play in creating a more circular supply chain. In addition to P&G, key NGO partners (ex/WWF) and key retailers (ex/ Walmart) also attended and presented on the importance of sustainability across the end to end supply chain. The supplier summit was well received, and coming out of this initial two day event, we hosted a followup series of (3) deep dive webinars on how companies can set science based GHG targets. P&G sponsored and co-hosted these webinars with WWF, providing background on our own SBT journey while including tangible examples from some of our leading suppliers who already have science based targets."}]}}

CRC is the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production company in California on a gross-operated basis. The Company operates its world class resource base exclusively within the State of California, applying integrated infrastructure to gather, process and market its production. Using advanced technology, CRC focuses on safely and responsibly supplying affordable energy for California by Californians.CRC explores for, develops, and produces oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas in 137 fields in California's four major oil and gas basins (San Joaquin, Los Angeles, Ventura and Sacramento) with 12,451 gross producing wellbores as of December 31, 2018. We are the largest private oil and natural gas mineral acreage holder in California, with interests in approximately 2.2 million net mineral acres. Our proved reserves totaled an estimated 712 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe) at December 31, 2018. CRC also generates electricity and gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas and power.In 2018, CRC supplied 98 thousand barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 202 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. We also supplied 259 gross megawatts of electricity per day through our power plant at Elk Hills, enough power to supply a city the size of Anaheim, the 10th most populous city in California.As a company dedicated to fostering sustainable growth to meet future energy needs for California by Californians, CRC proudly shares and endorses the State's commitment to conserve our natural resources and protect our environment. We are committed to managing our assets in a manner that safeguards people and protects the environment, and we lead proactive engagement with regulatory agencies, communities and other stakeholders to pursue mutually beneficial outcomes. We benefit the communities where we live and work through capital investments, job creation and payment of taxes and royalties, and by actively promoting conservation of water, habitat and energy. We operate in sensitive coastal, urban and agricultural settings by applying advanced production technologies and control systems, as well as innovative environmental safeguards and conservation measures. We design and maintain our facilities throughout the State with our neighbors, communities and the environment in mind."}]}}

Our business model relies heavily on shipping and logistics, a small part of which is done directly by eBay Inc. businesses, but the majority of which occurs downstream of and out of our direct control. Increasing energy prices could quickly translate into higher shipping and logistics costs. These risks are monitored by our delivery and logistics teams and as part of their ongoing cost review and projections. The Impact team interacts with this team on a regular basis to assess if any risks have been identified specific to transportation and logistics and incorporates this information into our overall risk assessment. This risk (including cross-border trade) has also been identified by our ERM function and is noted in our 10-k. If those costs are passed on in the prices offered to customers on our commerce sites, this could drive down demand for on-line shopping, causing overall harm to eBay's business."}]}}

The Base year emissions of 197,448 metric tonnes - 156,203 (2019) = 41,245 metric tonnes = 20.9% reduction from the base year (41,245/197,448) x 100.Rogers continues to place great importance on the reduction of emissions through the focus on the reduction in the consumption of all energies though capital expenditures, governance and operational efficiencies.Our Enterprise Risk Management program assists our business leaders in the identification, assessment and treatment of risks. Annually, our ERM team carries out our annual strategic risk assessment to identify our key risks in achieving our corporate objectives. Our ERM with the business leaders identify risks at the business unit level by considering risks that may impact our strategic, operational, financial, and regulatory / compliance objectives and goals, including any risks related to environmental / climate factors.Whether it be the management of our real estate assets, our cell tower infrastructure, our media business or our Rogers for Business products and services, we manage our environmental risk through committed resources, policies, programs and published targets all aimed at reducing our environmental footprint. Each year since 2014, we conduct an environmental materiality assessment, which defines our priority areas to continually build programs, targets and performance metrics on.

These events can potentially increase financial burden on consumers' disposable incomes and damages to infrastructures essential to our operations. Our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in Florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods) or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations.

The carbon footprint was calculated with IPCC 2013 methodology and Ecoinvent datasets. Based on weight and material types of purchased goods (assumed = to sold products), assume 50% landfill, 50% incineration of each material type (nine different material types considered, e.g. plastic, steel, batteries, cardboard, etc.). Recycling benefits not considered (as per GHG Protocol guidelines).The quantities of material assumed disposed of at the end-of-life as well as the modelling approach for this category were similar YOY. The main differences can be explained by a difference in the composition of the materials treated at the end-of-life. 2016 data contained more cardboard while 2017 data contained more metal which have lower environmental factors for end-of-life treatment compared to cardboard."}]}}

With 80% of our leases up for renewal in the next 4 years, we have a significant opportunity to leverage green leases for offices/buildings which have LEED or similar certifications and will help lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Typically, these lease costs are higher, but we expect operating costs to decline as a result of energy efficiency measures. Operational excellence through energy efficiency is the core of our short- and long-term energy strategy. We also prioritize the purchase of clean energy locally where possible and for buildings where we have operational control. A sample of annual energy efficiency projects implemented to date include: sensor technology, LED lighting, sub-metering, and demand-response software. Projects implemented to date have average return on investments (ROIs) of less than 3 years, and these projects have cumulatively helped save more than US $1.7 million in operating expenses since we began tracking. We anticipate similar savings as well as a reduction in Scope 2 GHG emissions going forward with continued investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy and green leases."}]}}

Under such a scheme, the following price increase could be expected: gasoline (13%), natural gas (37%), and propane (36%). Electricity rate increases would vary by region based on the utility generation mix. However, the Department of Commerce estimates that a $30/metric ton CO2e carbon tax would increase average retail electricity rates by 5.3%. Hedging against such electric price increases with alternative energy sources could reasonably save us over $2,500,000 annually in Nevada alone. Applied to our global operations potential savings would be on the order of 8,000,000."}]}}

This would add costs to fuel and electricity. Increases in these energy prices will affect operational costs for Rogers fleet (gasoline/diesel) as well as in buildings and network operations (electricity/natural gas). Rogers is managing this risk through continuous improvement energy and resource efficiencies to reduce operating costs where applicable. Specifically, Rogers implemented many energy and fuel conservation projects across numerous sites in 2017, as detailed in this report. Rogers also dedicates a codified budgetary amount every year for investment in energy conservation projects."}]}}

Within each country, environmental teams ensure that the company operates in compliance with these laws and regulations, under the general oversight of Bunge's local legal department. For example in Brazil, Bunge observes and complies with applicable laws pertaining to legal reserves in its rural operations for sugarcane farming, in particular the requirement to restore previously farmed land. This may have an effect on the current farming capability. Nevertheless legal and regulatory staff in our South America office regularly monitor and review Bunge's practices to ensure, at a minimum, that operations are in compliance with local laws. In furthering Bunge's commitment to zero deforestation globally, national- and regional-level teams also comply with company-wide policies that in many cases go beyond the legal requirements of the national government or municipality."}]}}

Prolonged periods of drought and continued water consumption levels could reduce production capacity, increase operational costs, and/ or affect our license to operate in watersheds that are acutely stressed in India and Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Brazil and Spain.Our climate risk assessment was performed jointly by Four Twenty Seven and Climate Earth. Climate Earth generated a condensed analysis of transaction and resource consumption levels at different tiers and locations in the supply chain through a proprietary model supported by Multi-Regional Input-Output and Life-Cycle Analysis, using input-output (I-O) tables from the EPA and global trade flow data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics database. Four Twenty Seven applied its proprietary risk indicators, which capture direct and indirect risks from climate change, ranging from extreme weather events to long-term temperature and precipitation shifts and socio-economic vulnerability. Four Twenty Seven's climate modeling outputs include multiple temperature and precipitation indices that measure changes in both average and extreme conditions in the present and future. They evaluate past and future climates using an ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models from <PHONE>, forming the baseline climatology. They then run future simulations for the period 2020-2050. Four Twenty Seven selected an above-average warming scenario, RCP 8.5, to represent the least mitigation effort and greatest increase in warming; however, on a 25-year timescale, the discrepancies between scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) are minimal. They acknowledge a level of uncertainty exists in both the climate model projections and the assumptions taken about non-linear business impacts. They have applied strict statistical validation methods to account for model uncertainties and to ensure a practicable level of directional accuracy in these estimates."}]}}

Energy prices, in particular oil and natural gas, have fluctuated in recent years, with a corresponding effect on our production costs. Potential legislation, regulatory action and international treaties related to climate change may result in increases to energy costs. To date, at least 40 countries and 24 subnational regions (states, provinces, etc.) have already or are scheduled to soon make polluters pay with a national or regional price on carbon. Since 1997, there has been a 20-fold increase in the number of global climate change laws, according to the most comprehensive database of relevant policy and legislation (Source: Mapped: Climate change laws around the world). We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue, with the potential for further legislation and regulations that could affect our operations and financial condition. Foreign, federal, state and local regulatory/legislative bodies have proposed various measures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions and energy policies (for example, California expanded its cap-and-trade program to cover 85% of GHG emissions, impacting five Greif production facilities in Southern California. In China, at least 9 regulatory changes are impacting our operations (China accounts for 2.4% of Greif's Scope 1 emissions), including reductions in hazardous fine particulate matter, capping of particulate matter, and increased air pollution inspections. Examples of these regulations include the Integrated Emission Standards for Air Pollutants and Volatile Organic Compound Emission Standards. Due to these changes in legislation/regulation, we could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines to our company and could negatively affect our business, however also afford us the opportunity to proactively improve our energy efficiency, thereby reducing our costs and exposure to these risks. We have entered into short-term contracts to hedge certain of our energy costs, but are also taking more permanent measures that positively impact our business, for example, investing in renewable energy."}]}}

We want to recognize those sites that demonstrate their commitment to climate change and corporate responsibility through verified closure of the issues identified in a site audit.During the audit, we classify areas of non-conformance as ''priority,\" ''major,\" ''minor\" or ''for review.\" We provide each supplier with a written performance assessment and work with our suppliers to close gaps identified in the on-site audits. For example, one of our suppliers established a procedure to manage energy consumption, but it did not establish annual targets on GHG reduction, so through the corrective action process we provided support in order for the suppliers to set up GHG objectives and targets and close the gap. We have initially measured success based on the performance levels of our suppliers against the code of conduct (e.g. Needs Improvement / Achieving / Maintain). Supplier performance has improved over time with more suppliers achieving higher performance levels from 2012 to 2015 than prior to 2012.In 2019, Xerox conducted 24 initial audits and closed 6 audits that were initiated before 2019 in various Asian countries. As compared to the initial audit findings, the average supplier conformance level observed during the closure audits increased 53.1% to 71.2%.However, other positive outcomes include for example Delta Electronics, a Taiwan-based supplier producing power supply units to Xerox. As a result of the audits Delta tracks its environmental performance including electricity intensity (KWh of electricity consumption/MUSD of output value) and has committed to reduce its electricity intensity by 30% (compared to 2014) by 2020. This follows its reduction of electricity intensity of main manufacturing facilities by 50% from 2010 to 2014."}]}}

We implement globally our Local Risk Assessment (LRA) methodology utilizing granular local data to highlight water-related risks and engaging local stakeholders including tobacco suppliers. PMI utilizes the LRA results to implement initiatives with farmers to improve agricultural resiliency to flooding and drought such as the case in Indonesia where the results of the 2018 LRA led to the planning and implementation of interventions in 2019. Focus trial projects to mitigate the effects of drought impacts on cultivated crops were deployed in clove and tobacco growing areas. In particular, drip irrigation systems have been tested with farmers in clove production to increase resiliency, reduce dependency on rainfall and avoid productivity losses. Another example is the improved water access through the installation of deep wells in a tobacco growing area to ensure the continuous availability of water for crop irrigation and human consumption, in collaboration with our local supplier, to avoid potentially negative impacts to the crop due to changing weather patterns, supported by a thorough investigation of the deep well's impact on the groundwater level.In order to ensure business continuity, PMI has substantial inventories of tobacco leaf which can help mitigate short to medium term impacts (up to 5 years).The cost of response is based on the set yearly budget $0.2M (i.e. we set a single amount and it is not possible to provide a breakdown) allocated in 2019 to environmental projects (mainly related to climate change, water security and biodiversity) under the Good Agricultural Practices program implementation in Indonesia. The engagement with tobacco and clove suppliers to trial improvements in crop management practices in Indonesia it is included in the cost of response. The expenditures represent approx. 4% of the 2019 global GAP budget. We have engaged with our tobacco suppliers to improve crop management practices and are strengthening our supply chain for tobacco at an overall cost of several tens of millions of US$ (represented by the entire GAP budget). Similar yearly investment is expected over the next 10 years considering projected climate change related impacts and the potential scale-up of current projects."}]}}

Additionally, the global supply management (GSM) team has goals around cost reductions for energy use at the sites. The team often brings in third parties to complete energy audits and find energy reductions. Sites then submit these suggestions through the FAR process. The FAR process prioritizes projects based on benefit to the business. The business' energy reduction goals help to further push and prioritize these projects.

Our sample's calculations included full-time, commuting only employees from Tier 1 and Tier 2 offices. FY18 survey data was used as proxy to reflect estimated geographical differences in distance traveled, and number of working days. Commuter mode is based on average mode split from the Americas and India per our transportation team. Estimate sample calculation includes vehicle and passenger miles and represents about 70% of global commuters. For the remaining 30% of commuting employees emissions calculations, we used vehicle miles and US average commute distance and working days. And for final emission calculations, we utilized EPA emissions factors Table 8. This number also includes emissions from employee vehicle leases, which are determined based on spend, and utilizing Environmentally Extended Economic Input Output (EEIO) lifecycle analysis (LCA) emissions factors to quantify the emissions."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: Sempra's ERM program also considers the impact of transition risk and new technologies. Given the importance of technology to our business (smart meters, smart grid, time-of-use rates, solar net metering, energy storage and battery technology) and a future that will involve digitalization, our risk assessments include energy, IT and cybersecurity technologies that are critical to our company and in addition to technologies that could disrupt our current way of doing business and require adaptation. For example, our electric utility in SDG&E when considering the advancement and increase of distributed solar throughout their service territory, considers what risks this may represent to the company and to customers. Since bills don't yet include a charge for use and maintenance of the grid, the cost differential is rising, year over year, in an unfair cost shift, which amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars in costs so far. This unfair situation results in non-solar customers paying to maintain and improve the electric grid for solar-owning customers who continue to use the grid. A regulatory strategy has been developed to work with stakeholders to develop a sustainable rate design that recognizes the services provided to distributed generation customers in a way that achieves fairness and also promotes renewable resource installation at the customer level."}]}}

We reach out to customers through a variety of channels, including mobile phones, email, web, and social media channels. The vast majority of customers can view and download their hourly usage and cost data, in addition to comparing their usage to that of similar homes in their neighborhood. Our Home Energy Checkup and Business Energy Checkup tools allow our residential and small and medium business customers to find energy savings ideas by providing tips and savings recommendations to help them manage their energy costs.Share My Data allows customers to share their energy usage data with select third party service providers to determine if energy products and services such as solar installations may be right for them. We measure a composite score of customer satisfaction and are committed to improving satisfaction.In 2018, PG&E's programs helped customers save approximately $300 million on their energy bills and avoid the emission of more than 280,000 metric tons of CO2. We also brought the total number of interconnected private solar customers to nearly 400,000 and expanded our energy efficiency financing program, which provides commercial customers and government agencies with loans for energy efficiency upgrades with no out-of-pocket costs and zero interest, funding nearly 800 loans worth a total of $37.6 million. PG&E also began construction of new charging stations under our EV Charge Network program, installing nearly 600 Level 2 charging ports at workplaces and multi-family dwellings.In 2018, our customer satisfaction rose to 77.3, exceeding our target of 75.2. The increase in 2018 was driven by customer satisfaction with service reliability and pricing. Customer focus and customer service satisfaction also significantly improved in 2018.In 2019, PG&E began using a metric tracking the customer complaints escalated to the CPUC as the customer-related metric for our Short-Term Incentive Plan, replacing the customer satisfaction score. Our 2019 target is a 12.2 complaint rate per 100,000 adjusted customers.Each year we also benchmark our customer satisfaction results against best-in-class performing gas and electric providers."}]}}

Poor OTP may be a result of mudslides, wildfires, track work, or reduced speeds during heat waves and high winds. While these impacts are relevant, the potential link to climate-related risk assessment is not consistently made. We understand there are certain conditions that will cause delays and service disruptions - such as severe weather events. To mitigate impact to Amtrak's reputation, we've focused on improving our immediate communication with customers to keep them informed of the reason for delay or the slower speeds. We're working with internal teams to more accurately track and monitor costs and delays caused by severe weather events and poor OTP. This data will help quantify the financial impact as well as help stakeholders implement solutions to mitigate these service impacts as conditions become more severe."}]}}

In some cases, the risk is a result of a longer period that can have a cumulative effect. An example of this risk to NS is extreme cold which can contribute to broken rail and, in turn, may lead to derailments along with interrupting train movements. Extreme heat can also cause rail alignment issues. Weather-related patrols must be significantly increased during periods of temperature extremes to identify weakened or misaligned rail to prevent business interruptions. These patrols are also inspecting track for signs of undermining due to erosion or increasingly higher water levels in the adjacent areas. In order to proactively address the slow, chronic impact of weather pattern changes, the inspections identify necessary projects to strengthen the rail bed in order to avoid future rail failure and derailment."}]}}

Xerox can reduce interruption and keep customers ''up and running\" after they have been impacted as a result of realization of climate change risks and in turn enable them to adapt to the physical changes associated with climate change.For example, increased demand for Xerox cloud-based products would result in increased revenue to Xerox. In 2018, revenue from Xerox Intelligent Workplace Services offering (which includes our workflow automation services portfolio) was ~$3,457 Million. Therefore, assuming a maximum 0.5% increase in our annual revenue from our Intelligent Workplace Services offering equates to up to a ~$17 Million per year increase in sales revenue (i.e. 0.5% of $3457 Million).The estimated financial impact and potential increase in revenue is therefore estimated to range from $0 to $17 Million per year."}]}}

Our target follows a financial year calendar. Our fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31 of the following year. From September 1, 2014 to August 31st, 2019, Cogeco has achieved a GHG intensity reduction of 24%, signifying 240% achievement of our 10% intensity reduction target. This reduction is the result of various energy efficiency initiatives in our buildings, as well as fuel and operational efficiency initiatives in our fleet. Specifically in FY19 we implemented LED lighting upgrades, thermostat control installations and HVAC upgrades at various locations, and replaced 113 vehicles with new, more fuel-efficient vehicles. We also reduced fleet emissions through the use of auxiliary batteries to reduce fuel consumption from idling, and reduced fleet truck rolls through customer self-installation and preventative maintenance initiatives. In addition, consolidation of travel arrangements across all business units through one travel agency and the increased use of telephone and video conferencing tools helped drive reductions in emissions from business travel. Note that emission reductions include reduced carbon intensity across the various power grids where we operate. Also, our base year emissions were restated to reflect the sale of Cogeco Peer 1 and the acquisition of Metrocast in the U.S. We are currently in the process of developing a new, more aggressive absolute emissions reduction target in line with the recently released SBT guidance for the ICT sector."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: We consider the downstream impacts of our products in our CO2 risk assessments as sometimes relevant via our management meetings. We review these impacts via our Business Plan Review (BPR) and Special Attention Review (SAR) processes. The senior leadership team as led by the CEO (representing all skill teams and business units) holds monthly BPR meetings to review our management of sustainability and other business issues. Ford's sustainability scorecard is reviewed alongside our business units' scorecards at these meetings. The SAR process brings the senior leadership team together to review significant matters in more detail, and to develop action plans and strategies to address more specific risks and opportunities.Our CO2 glidepath provides a science-based approach to determine the emission reduction levels for 2degC temperature stabilization, in alignment with the Paris Climate Accord, over time, and assumes a certain level of lifetime miles traveled to assess CO2 emissions from the in-use car fleet.Example #1 of downstream risk: We review our product development plans semi-annually (or more often) to ensure our vehicles are aligned with the 2degC stabilization glide path. While our plans are based upon delivering long-term reductions in CO2 emissions from new vehicles that are similar to those for the industry-average LDV glide paths, we anticipate that the reductions will vary from year to year. This is due to market forces that we do not fully control, such as energy price fluctuation, changes in the mix of vehicles demanded by consumers and other factors that influence our product plans.Recognizing the long timeframe of climate science, we update our glide path model's assumptions and input data every five years. Our 2degC temperature stabilization pathway is specific to the LDV sector. We also evaluated an LDV 1.5degC sensitivity scenario. We conduct other sensitivity analyses to understand the effect on the glide paths of global changes, such as economic conditions, biofuel availability or regulations.Example #2 of downstream risk: We also have partnerships with the petroleum industry to encourage improved fuel quality, to minimize climate change impact downstream as a result of customers fueling their vehicles."}]}}

These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating, and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment, and monitoring obligations. Complying with these regulations drives us to increase investment in emissions reduction projects, such as our solar and offshore wind projects, and shut down existing high-emitting power stations."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: Technology factors into our consideration of climate change risks and opportunities in a number of ways. First, Apple is a technology company that delivers products to our customers. These products have a carbon footprint, which we calculate through a carbon life cycle assessment (LCA) process. This impact represents both a risk and opportunity for Apple. We leverage the LCA data in order to reduce emissions associated with product throughout its lifecycle. For example, in the production of the iPhone 8, Apple utilizes aluminum that is smelted using hydroelectricity rather than fossil fuels, and we reengineered the manufacturing process to reincorporate scrap aluminum. As a result, every gram of aluminum used in iPhone 8 generates 11 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the aluminum used in iPhone 7, and 83 percent less than the aluminum used in iPhone 6. An additional technology risk of climate change includes policy requirements to implement climate-friendly technologies such as renewable energy technologies. Our 100% renewable energy goal aimed at reducing carbon emissions from our global operations is made possible by the rapid adoption of these technologies, reducing our exposure to the associated risk. The evolution of renewable energy technology has affected the cost, selection, and efficiency of renewable energy solutions. As an example, we leveraged emerging renewable energy technology at Apple Park, Apple's new headquarters in Cupertino. Apple Park is powered by 100 percent renewable energy from multiple sources, including a 17-megawatt onsite rooftop solar installation and 4 megawatts of biogas fuel cells. The new headquarters even provides clean energy back to the public grid through the use of battery storage and a microgrid during periods of low occupancy."}]}}

Linde's sustainable productivity organization measures the environmental savings in our productivity work along with the financial benefits such optimization measures bring. As part of Linde's new 2028 sustainable development targets, Linde has defined a target to achieve $ 1.3 billion savings from sustainable productivity initiatives. Linde's sustainable productivity target measures productivity projects that bring financial and environmental savings in all our EKPI areas, including savings in energy and GHG. All of Linde's new SD targets are managed targets, that means they are tracked periodically by management including annual MC and board oversight and are part of financial management incentives. This target therefore additionally drives management engagement in this area.In 2019, energy and GHG efficiency projects resulted in savings of more than $85 million, 440 million kwh and 505,000 MT CO2e avoided (counting both implemented projects and projects where implementation has commenced but full benefits will accrue in 2020). These projects contributed to a reduction in electricity use as well as reductions in natural gas and fuel use."}]}}

(Technology , Acute physical , Chronic physical , Emerging regulation, Legal , Market , Reputation , Current regulation)\n\nAnswer: Current regulations are relevant and always included in the Company's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks because (1) telecommunications is a highly regulated industry and (2) our operational footprint includes many countries with different regulatory requirements, and the consequences for non-compliance could negatively impact our operations, financial performance, and reputation. See the Company's Annual Report on form 10-K filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 28 February 2020, under Item 1A 'Risk Factors'. An example of a current regulation related to climate change risk that the Company has identified, assessed and is currently managing is the Renewable Energy Standard (RES) in Colorado US. This law/regulation requires investor-owned utilities to generate 30% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. This regulation and its revisions have the potential to increase energy costs for the Company's operations in Colorado. Through careful monitoring of the state regulatory environment we were able to identify the potential risks and opportunities from this regulation and take action to mitigate the risk. For example, facility energy efficiency projects (equipment optimization, upgrading building control systems, lighting replacement initiatives) were implemented to mitigate the risk of increased energy costs that may arise from this regulation."}]}}

Programs include the promotion of energy efficiency at home, low impact vegetation management, wildlife appreciation, increased recycling (office and industrial) and a reduction in overall waste generation. Our grass-roots Eco-Team runs an annual ECO-challenge, a week-long event where employees across the corporation are challenged to make life style changes that result in GHG footprint reductions and the Eco-Warrior Challenge where employees are challenged to see how many carbon-reducing activities they can achieve in one day. Activities are translated into GHG reductions, and increase awareness of the collective impact our employees can have on improving the environment through simple changes in their behavior. Emissions savings as presented are the project based Scope 3 reductions associated with our Eco-Team employee events. These initiatives are voluntary and run from year to year. Investment relates to annual seed funding provided by Exelon to the EcoTeams. There are no corporate cost savings associated with these actions. Payback on the initiative is immediate with regard to employee engagement benefits. This is counted as one project implemented under 4.3a."}]}}

We expect to see more GHG emissions regulations and are well positioned to service our customers with expertise and support. Starting in 2009, we assembled an Alternative Fuels and Vehicles Strategy Team to review alternative fuel platforms and to identify new market opportunities. In 2010, Ryder expanded these efforts with an Alternative Fuel Natural Gas Council. In 2015, Ryder announced one of the largest investments in its advanced energy portfolio: the launch of a new online NGV maintenance training program for its entire North American maintenance network. The program provides the technician workforce with knowledge of NGV platforms and configurations to better serve customers who commit to converting all or part of their fleets. And in 2019, Ryder committed to investing in electric vehicle technology vehicles and infrastructure at its FMS locations. ii) To date, Ryder NG vehicles travelled over 280 million miles, and replaced over 42 million gallons of diesel fuel with lower emission natural gas. Ryder partnered with Anheuser-Busch to replace 66 of the beer company's diesel tractors with compressed natural gas (CNG) powered engines. With one of the largest fleets in the US, Ryder plays a leadership role in the natural gas market. Additionally, Ryder added certified clean idle vehicles to its fleet meeting the EPA 2010 emissions standard. Ryder invests in purchasing strategies including evaluation of the environmental and performance standards of suppliers.We will continue to invest in state-of-the-art vehicles, fleet management and diagnostic technologies that expand these capabilities and maximize vehicle performance, cargo routing, fuel usage, and driving skills. For example, Ryder has invested $100 million to offer customers natural gas vehicles; has 61 NGV compliant maintenance facilities and more than 6,200 NGV trained technicians and support employees across the US and Canada."}]}}

Completed the installation of solar PV systems at multiple Las Vegas properties 2. Completed registration with both the Nevada NV TREC and regional WREGIS online systems of renewable energy credits inventory and tracking 3. Conducted research on local and regional Nevada PEC/REC markets including availability and pricing of these PECs/RECs 4. Negotiated transactions with outside parties for the sale of MGM generated Nevada RECs increasing revenueThe primary case study is the 2016 completion of the final phase of the rooftop solar PV system at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas. This system in 2018 generated approximately 25,000 annual Nevada-specific Portfolio Energy Credits (PECs), the Nevada equivalent of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for the purpose of compliance with the Nevada Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). These available PECs are marketable instruments to the multiple organizations that are subject to compliance with the Nevada RPS. As such, MGM has entered into multiple transactions to sell these PECs and realize increased revenues as a result.The cost to realize this overall opportunity is calculated at $15,000. This is the value of 250 hours of internal expertise and time undertaken at $60 per hour."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: The GHG team meets monthly to review the outcomes of regulatory reviews by its in-house members and third-party SMEs. As emerging regulations are identified, they are reviewed for potential impacts or influences on 7G's operations, finances and capital plans. These outcomes are communicated to its functional teams for planning and factored into the annual GHG strategy and planning session and corporate risk assessment/register. Emerging regulations identified as having a substantive risk to the operation are raised to the senior leadership team on an as needed basis.Notably, provincial elections in Alberta occurred in the first half of 2019. As a result, 7G recognizes the potential shift to federal climate change regulations. The implications of this shift include changes to the carbon tax structure, a shift to output-based allocations for facilities emitting greater than 50,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year and LDAR requirements noted under the existing federal regulation. This requires a higher degree of LDAR activity across approximately 100 of its assets (to three times per year under the federal regulations) versus 36 facilities requiring three times per year (under Alberta Directive 60) and expand its large emitters from Karr Stabilization Facility (under Alberta regulations) to also include Lator 2, Cutbank, and Pads 08-06 and 2-31. Notably, the United Conservative Party was elected in March 2019 - the impacts of this election and the UCP's repeal of the Alberta Climate Leadership Act in June 2019, will be discussed in the 2019 CDP report."}]}}

The actions taken in the past several years, including 2019, to realize this opportunity include alterations to our structure, our strategic objectives and our operational development plans to support Vermilion as a distributed energy provider. Examples of changes made to support being a distributed energy provider include the addition Board and Executive oversight related to Integrated Sustainability in 2018. Vermilion also initiated exploration and development programs in regions with relatively low energy production as compared to consumption (e.g. Hungary, Croatia). In 2018, we also assumed operatorship of the Corrib gas field in Ireland and increased our ownership in the project from 18.5 to 20%. We have also expanded our regions to include Slovakia as an area for which a domestic energy supply would increase energy security while providing environmentally and socially responsible production.The costs associated with adjustment of our organizational structure are built into our costs across the organization.

Since our climate-related risk assessment is integrated into a company-wide risk process, our Sustainability team works with our Risk Management team annually to evaluate climate-related transition and physical risks on a time horizon of up to 5 years. Based on our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) methodology and current business model, the transition and physical risks have all been deemed as ''very low\" risks. Despite this, we have a specific climate change risk management process related to data center and office site selection that occurs each time we open a new facility, which can occur more often that every 6 months. In addition, we have practices in place to reduce our GHG emissions, mitigating most of the other identified risks. Sea level rise was one of the risks we analyzed which looked further than 6 years. We plan to revisit these transition and physical risks annually to ensure no significant changes have occurred."}]}}

(Technology , Acute physical , Chronic physical , Emerging regulation, Legal , Market , Reputation , Current regulation)\n\nAnswer: The technology risk of the impact of disruptive technologies is considered in our ERM process based on assessments conducted by the business unit manager and the ERM group. The risk is recorded and monitored to determine the magnitude of the risk and the associated mitigated measures. This risk is considered a (04) rating in terms of financial significance, a (03) rating in terms of operational significance and a (04) rating in terms of reputational significance.Risk associated with new technologies remains a particularly acute concern for APS. As more emerging technologies, such as energy storage devices, become commercially viable, they will continue to change how our customers interact with us. By being proactive and working with our customers to identify and respond to their changing needs, we remain well positioned to deliver value. And by providing customers the opportunity to manage their own energy and peak demand, we can expand the use and understanding of load-management technologies, encourage customers to use energy during off-peak hours and better align with solar production and system peak conditions.These technology risks may cause potential resource substitutions and diversification that may impact our ability to operate in various conditions as demand for electricity shifts and diversifies. To address this shift to new technologies, APS is deploying a wide array of new distributed energy resource (DER) technologies to provide clean, reliable, affordable energy to its customers. These include battery storage, thermal storage, load management, electric vehicles and other beneficial electrification technologies that have the potential to increase the value of intermittent generation resources as well as increase grid reliability and stability.APS has a number of current and future planned initiatives that utilize DER technologies. Given the array of potential applications for energy storage, APS evaluates storage technologies on an ongoing basis. We currently plan to install at least 850 MW of energy storage by 2025, including 150 MW of energy storage projects under power purchase agreements. The additional 700 MW of APS-owned energy storage is expected to be made up of energy storage that will be added to our existing AZ Sun solar sites, along with current and future RFPs for energy storage and solar-plus-energy-storage projects."}]}}

The diversity of the company's business mix is advantageous for responding to existing and emerging GHG emissions regulations and climate change legislation.In 2019, freight revenue generated by the transportation of the energy business unit was $246.2 million. This represented approximately 9% of the Company's total consolidated revenue. Therefore, a decrease in demand for utility coal, frac sand, petroleum coke, and crude oil could have financial implications ranging from 0-9% of revenues. KCS' revenue in 2019 totaled $2.866 billion therefore the potential financial impact is anywhere from $0 to $246.2 million."}]}}

Akamai's travel agencies provide quarterly per employee flight data including origination and destination airport codes and cabin class for each flight segment. The methodology to convert flight data to CO2e is as follows: For commercial airline flights:1. The origination and destination airport codes entered are matched against the ICAO database and their latitude and longitudes identified. 2. These latitudes and longitudes are then plugged into an algorithm that calculates the great circle distance. This algorithm is based on the Haversine formula, which is commonly available and used to calculate flight distance between two points taking into account the spherical shape of the earth. As an example, look at <URL> 3. After flight segment mileage has been calculated, the system automatically assigns the flights as long, medium, or short haul based on the standard distance categorization of flights. 4. The system then looks at the seating type (economy, premium, business, etc.) and applies the emission factor(s) for that flight. If no seating is available, then a default EF is applied. 5. The calculations are done, and the global warming potentials are applied to obtain a CO2e result. These flight data include flights that were cancelled by employees and not flown.For flights on privately-owned jets:One of Akamai's executive's owns and operates a jet that that executive uses for Akamai-related business trips. That executive is not reimbursed by Akamai for this expense. 1. For each reporting year the company that manages the operations of the jet, paid for by the executive-owner, provides detailed flight data information for all trips the executive took during the year, including jet fuel consumed. 2. The jet fuel consumed, in gallons, for each flight (''fuel burn\"), is converted to CO2 by multiplying the jet fuel consumed by a jet fuel emission factor (9.57 kg CO2/gal).3. The CO2 emissions for each flight are summed to obtain the total CO2 emissions for the reporting year.Because the executive owns and has operational control of the jet, Akamai categorizes the emissions for this travel as Scope 3, similar to an employee who drives her/his own car on business."}]}}

Should such weather events occur more frequently and with greater severity, it could result in a material impact on Duke Energy's future operations. Destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, severe thunderstorms, and snow and ice storms can result in damage to company assets, including damaged transmission and distribution lines, resulting in significant power outages. Outages present disruptions to our customers, lost operating revenues, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. An example of such costs was that, in 2018, destructive Hurricanes Florence and Michael affected Duke Energy's service territory, causing the company to incur over $1.1 billion in power restoration costs. The potential financial impact assumes ten such Florence/Michael storms over ten years. This estimate is illustrative only and the actual costs would be event-specific and dependent on the size, severity, and number of events, if any. Note also that the Company has recovery mechanisms as follows: Florida and South Carolina - storm cost recovery reserve; North Carolina - ability to request deferral treatment of costs and obtain recovery either through future rate cases or securitization."}]}}

However, this accounted for only about 19% of total spend. Therefore, for our estimate to be representative of 100% spend in this category, we relied on secondary data for scale-up. This was accomplished using an average carbon intensity metric (metric tonnes CO2e/$) calculated from primary supplier data, which was representative of Ford's purchased goods and services suppliers who reported reliable emissions data, and multiplying it using spend not already accounted for by primary data. Please note that CO2 emissions from suppliers of upstream transportation are not included in this category as indicated in the GHG protocol to avoid double counting with scope 3, category 4 (upstream transportation and distribution)."}]}}

In 2017 the impact of this engagement was a 100% response rate, which contributed to PMI's achieving a CDP Supply Chain A rating. We had a supplier respond to the CDP for the first time and our invitation was the main driver. The information received has been used to fine tune our carbon footprint model in 2017. Different one-on-one meetings have occurred with direct materials and logistics suppliers like acetate tow, paper or ocean logistics and a collaboration has started to reduce emissions.Our tobacco leaf suppliers are contractually required to implement GAP program. To assess suppliers' conformity against GAP, the Sustainable Tobacco Program (STP) is used which includes an annual self-assessment and on-site reviews by AB Sustain, an independent company. As part of the on-site review, AB Sustain looks for metrics and performance on reducing water and GHG emissions, eliminating hazardous pesticides, using of bio-pesticides, reforestation, soil and waste management. Based on the assessed scores and our measure of success is we expect our leaf suppliers to demonstrate continuous improvements year on year. Results of these assessments are included in our supplier scorecards and used to make future decisions such as tobacco purchase volume allocation through our supplier base. GAP is also the foundation of our goal to transform resiliency and tolerance of tobacco crops to effects of climate change. We also have a measure of success to reduce the GHG emission intensity related to tobacco curing by 70% by 2020, compared to a 2010 baseline. We are well on track with a 38% reduction achieved as of 2017. A monitoring and verification framework has been launched in 2017 across our leaf supply chain to monitor and verify the impact of the more than 40 initiatives being implemented. These initiatives support the achievement of our 70% carbon footprint reduction goal by2020 by eliminating the use of coal and non-sustainable firewood, promoting the use of alternative biomass fuels and improving curing efficiency.For equipment manufacturers, by 2020 we expect primary data to cover at least 80% of our value chain emissions for our LCA."}]}}

Through supply chain and life-cycle assessments, News Corp has already measured major product categories, and by working with key suppliers has reduced the carbon footprint and manufacturing cost of key products.Because the costs of these actions are combined with other sustainability and business initiatives and strategies, it is difficult to provide precise investment figures. However, News Corp continues to invest strategically in sustainability, including in energy efficiency, systems for measuring and tracking energy usage, and analyses of supply chains to find opportunities for improvement."}]}}

We engaged both clients and NGOs on issues related to GHG emissions and climate change strategies through meetings, external networking, grant making and annual surveys. We share best practices and discuss ideas on how to better partner on an ongoing basis. For example, in November 2019, we held a meeting with some of our largest corporate clients to discuss low carbon product and initiatives. In 2019, we've also engaged with NGOs providing over $2.8 million in support of the environment and wildlife through our Gift Matching and Serve2Gether grant programs. We also have been supporting The Nature Conservancy Plant a Billion program since 2017.Our strategy for prioritization of our clients is determined by revenue generation and the maturity of their sustainability programs. We usually prioritize partnership with clients who have more progressive sustainability strategy. We prioritize engagement with NGOs based on their community impact and by ensuring their projects align with our giving strategy.Success is measured by the number of clients and NGOS that have been engaged on this topic. Over 100 corporate large clients participated in a session to discuss sustainability and business travel. We also continually try to engage with more of our supply chain on sustainability issues and clients as feasible. We continue to view increased engagement as an indicator of our CSR and sustainability programs."}]}}

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: For current regulation, under the direct supervision of the Board of Directors, risks are assessed at the company level through a standardized enterprise risk management (ERM ) process. Every business unit, every region and every corporate function participates in this formal process. Risks are measured using standard evaluation criteria. Results are consolidated and reviewed by senior leadership and presented to the Board. Through the ERM process, Eaton identifies top risks each year as ERM priorities are assigned to manage these risks, under the supervision of the Senior Leadership Committee (''SLC\") and the CEO. The EVP, EBS and Sustainability, is a member of the SLC and is responsible for climate related issues. The SLC meets quarterly on major business issues, including Environment, Health and Safety, a subset of which is climate change. Updates on mitigation activities and risk management are reported to the Board of Directors on an annual basis or more frequently depending on circumstances. Through the ERM process and other standard routines, our businesses address issues associated with climate change, including but not limited to customer requirements/issues (e.g., need for energy efficient products to address climate change regulations, consumer demands, profitability); operational issues (including new regulations and voluntary norms influenced by climate change); and supply chain (including weather related disruptions influenced by climate change.) For example, this process led to Eaton's endorsement of EPA's Phase I and Phase II Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and GHG standards for automotive passenger and commercial vehicles. The Phase II CAFE standards mandate that vehicle fleets ultimately achieve an average of 54.5 mpg by 2025, thereby reducing fuel use and carbon emissions. However, the process identified a risk that the current White House administration will reduce these mileage standards which will lessen the impact on climate change. The decision was relevant because freezing standards would impact Eaton's Vehicle Business which represents about 15% of Eaton's annual sales, or $3.5 billion in 2018. If we sold 1-3% fewer VEH products in the USA as a result of lower CAFE standards, the amount of reduced income could be approximately $2.15 million to $6.5 million, a medium to high impact on the corporation."}]}}

Through the Ford Partnership for a Cleaner Environment (PACE) program, we educate selected suppliers about ways to decrease their energy use (and therefore CO2 emissions). We ask suppliers to set CO2 emissions targets and report reductions to Ford. We monitor their progress and provide technical support as needed. Through the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), third-party auditors conduct environmental audits at selected supplier sites. We work with these suppliers to address any identified non-conformances.

If new taxes or regulations caused an increase in the cost of electricity, Juniper's operating costs could increase. It is unlikely that electricity costs would increase uniformly; however, if an increase in cost per MWh of 10% is assumed overall, Juniper's operating expense could increase between $3M and $3.5M per year. This hypothetical increase represents less than 0.15% of total operating expenses, and was selected due to its conservative nature (i.e. energy costs do not increase this significantly in our markets)."}]}}

Juniper's business continuity planning has positioned the company to respond to such events without losing production capacity. Management activities for weather events include the use of a SCRM system which collects data from key suppliers that maps components to production factories. This allows Juniper to instantly see and predict critical events and the severity of impact to the supply chain. With these notifications Juniper can contact suppliers to understand potential impacts to delivery and create mitigation plans. The proactive risk mitigation planning assesses resiliency; financial, location and recovery risks; and revenue impacts. The real-time data helps the operations team make strategic decisions which maximize uptime throughout the entire supply chain and minimize trade-offs. Juniper's business continuity program (BCP) assessment includes an assessment of supplier plans annually and reviews the outputs from manufacturing partners' annual testing process and provides input for improvement. This process has been implemented with 100% of our manufacturing partners and select critical component suppliers. This allows the company to identify and respond to potential crises in order to avoid losses from the physical impacts of climate change."}]}}

Since green bonds first came onto the market nearly a decade ago, we have been a leader in developing the market through collaborating with peers and have been the number one green bond underwriter globally from 2013 through end of 2019 according to Environmental Finance Green Bond Database.We were the first corporate to issue a benchmark-sized green bond and are the first U.S. financial institution to issue five corporate green bonds. In 2019, we issued our fifth corporate green bond for $2 billion to help finance renewable energy generation, bringing our total to $6.35 billion in directly issued corporate green bonds. Through our own issuances, we are advancing renewable energy generation by financing new projects-- such as a multistate residential solar portfolio and a wind turbine facility in Oklahoma. Examples of our 2019 green bond underwriting activity include the first ever SDG-linked bond by Italian energy company, Enel which we structured and led, and Europe's first Climate Bond issued by Snam S.p.A. Since 2007, we have underwritten $49 billion in green bonds on behalf of over 100 clients, supporting more than 288 deals and providing critical funding to environmental projects."}]}}

Customers could implement life style changes due to climate change as well as in response to higher electricity and natural gas costs. Customers could also install more customer-owned renewable generation if policies do not change as quickly as consumers desire them to change. This could result in decreased electric sales.It is likely that the price of electricity will increase as a result of climate-related regulations. Increased costs could impact customer consumption levels thereby impacting financial performance. Natural gas prices may also increase if utilities use that fuel to produce electricity, which could impact customer use of natural gas.In keeping with our commitment to incorporate more renewable energy in our generation portfolio, Ameren Missouri is working to advance community solar and solar partnership pilot projects as wells as a renewable choice program. Under the Community Solar pilot, customers will be able to subscribe for energy from an Ameren Missouri utility scale solar generation project that would be built once customers have subscribed for sufficient capacity. Under the Solar Partnership pilot, Ameren Missouri-owned solar generation projects can be constructed on the sites of business customers.In 2018, Ameren Missouri began offering The Renewable Choice Program which is designed to help participating customers meet their energy needs from clean, renewable generation.

The report shows that Cocoa Life is having a positive impact:* Cocoa yields are continuously improving and results show that as cocoa farms become more efficient, their yield increases. This is an important development, as farms that can do more with less land are able to create spare land that can be used for other income-generating activities, helping make cocoa farming a prosperous business.* More communities are steering their own development and Cocoa Life communities can become drivers of change. Through the use of planning and advocacy tools, these communities have been able to attract the funding and resources needed to develop -- an important step because sector change will only be sustained if local actors feel empowered to do so.* Farmers are choosing not to expand into protected forests and encouraging and enabling cocoa farmers and communities to protect the land where cocoa is grown has been fundamental to the Cocoa Life approach. Mapping efforts and tools support farmers in understanding how to get more out of their farms - helping them build better businesses.Since 2016, we have promoted a coordinated strategy and supply chain transparency by openly publishing our farm mapping updates online. This marked the first time a large cocoa sourcing company had disclosed locations of the cocoa farms they source from. We are the first branded food producer to partner with Global Forest Watch to implement satellite image mapping practices to analyze how Cocoa Life farms interact with forested and protected land. This allows us to intervene if farmers expand into protected areas. Our interactive online map provides public traceability of locations of Cocoa Life farms and supports farmers in improving yields. * As of 2018, 93,416 of Cocoa Life farms in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Indonesia (63% of the Cocoa Life farms in these origin regions) and they are not in priority protected forest areas. * Mondelez International commits to map 100% of Cocoa Life farms in these origin regions by the end of 2019.* These efforts reduce deforestation, reducing climate change impacts."}]}}

Using the average data method according to this standard, Praxair uses waste volumes provided by waste vendors and multiplies the waste treated by third parties for each waste treatment method by the associated emission factors. The amount of waste treated by third parties is recorded in our EKPI database according to the waste treatment methods (landfill, recycled, other). To calculate the CO2e emissions resulting from waste treated in landfills, Praxair multiplies the total amount of waste in this category by an emissions factor provided by the EPA, which is associated with the municipal waste mix in the United States. The IPCC suggests that any CO2e emissions associated with recycling should not be included in Scope 3 inventories. Therefore, Praxair uses an emissions factor of 0 for recycled waste treated by third parties. The small amount of waste which is not landfilled or recycled is calculated equally as if it were landfilled."}]}}

Examples of climate issues that are used in the modeling include but are not limited to flooding, hurricanes, and air quality, each of which can prevent access to components and raw materials. With an integrated layer of product, part, and component cost and sourcing data, the risk management platform enables the Operations team to instantly see and predict critical events and their severity of impact to the supply chain, such as prevention of access to single-source components needed for manufacturing. With these notifications, Juniper can immediately contact suppliers to understand potential impacts to delivery and, if needed, create mitigation plans. The Operations team is also working strategically with Juniper's Design for Resiliency team to strengthen the supply chain by designing for multi-sourcing. This will reduce the company's exposure to climate risks by reducing the reliance on single-origin sourcing. Juniper is actively enhancing the Company's resiliency by putting focus and energy into addressing risks early on in the lifecycle of products."}]}}

Most notably, in May 2017, MGM broke with the Nevada Resort Association and supported AB206, an ambitious measure to raise renewable energy generation standards to 50% by 2030, an increase in the current share of renewable energy of approximately 20%. MGM Resorts actively backed the bill, but it was ultimately was not adopted."}]}}

Also, third party reviews of physical risks to PACCAR facilities is performed annually. Evaluation of chronic physical risks includes determination of the magnitude of the financial risk. The significance of the financial impact of identified risks including climate-related risk is based on probabilities of both the likelihood of occurrence and potential financial impacts, and the materiality and estimability of probable risks in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices. The financial impact of climate-related risk is based on key assessment aspects including the proportion of business units affected, the size of the impact on those business units and the potential shareholder or customer concern. A substantive financial impact could occur due to a large change in one of these key aspects or a small change in all three aspects. For example, one of PACCAR's chronic physical risks includes a rise in sea levels over the next century, which could impact the structure and disrupt operations of our largest manufacturing plant located in Eindhoven, Netherlands."}]}}

Our operations and our products are subject to environmental regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and sell our products. For example, many of our products are already required to comply with the European Union's Energy-Related Products Directive (ERP) which has led to the adoption of ''implementing measures\" or \"voluntary agreements\" that require certain classes of products to achieve certain design and/or performance standards in connection with energy use, including the regulation of power consumption during standby/off mode and network standby. We must comply with applicable climate related regulations or potentially face market access limitations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Our EHS&S department tracks emissions and energy legislation and policy that affect the company through trade associations and partnerships. The CSR Council works with the Corporate Compliance Office to assure demonstration of compliance with climate related laws, regulations and policies. Consequently, we consider issues including environmental compliance and laws, regulations or voluntary agreements relating to our energy use, reporting our GHG emissions and the energy efficiency of our products when assessing our environmental/social/economic impacts in our corporate CSR materiality assessment, quarterly CSR meetings and ERM processes."}]}}

Dow participated in the most recent COP 24 in Madrid, Spain in 2019, advocating for a global framework with economy wide limits on GHG Emissions. Dow participates in several EU trade association working groups that promote GHG mitigation by contributing to the further development and design of EU ETS policies. Dow also engages in a number of emissions-trading focused organizations, including the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) which promotes the development of an international framework for trading in GHG reductions. Dow is an active participant in IETA regional working groups, including those in Canada, US and EU. Dow is also a long-standing and active member of the World Economic Forum, particularly its initiatives addressing climate change. Dow actively participates in the WEF's Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, whose goal is to build support for effective carbon markets around the world. Dow is also part of the CEO Climate Dialogue, a group of 21 companies with over $1.4 trillion in combined annual revenue and 4 leading environmental non-profit organizations that are committed to advancing climate action and durable federal climate policy in the U.S. Congress. The goal of the group is to urge the President and Congress to enact a market-based approach to climate change in accordance with a set of six Guiding Principles for climate legislation. One of the guiding principles is a market-based economy-wide price on carbon. In addition, last year Dow was one of the companies that was consulted to elaborate the report 'Getting to Zero' by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) Climate Innovation 2050 initiative. The report is a series of carbon policy recommendations to address the decarbonization challenge. Carbon pricing is one of the most relevant policies to reduce emissions and as such was included and supported by Dow in the report. Finally, in 2019 Dow provided a testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. During that testimony Dow highlighted the importance of carbon pricing and the proper use of the revenue collected by the price on carbon."}]}}

Although there are no current or planned congressional attempts to pass cap and trade legislation to regulate GHG emissions, in the event cap and trade legislation ultimately passes, the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known at this time. Factors include allowable GHG emissions; cost to reduce emissions; how any allowable emissions will be allocated to sources; the associated cost; and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available. However, for numerous years the APS Integrated Resource Plan has included a ''cost of carbon,\" which is factored into resource allocation decisions to address this potential cost to operations. Carbon tax costs are challenging to forecast because, despite numerous efforts, the federal government has not reached policy consensus on the magnitude, timing, or need for a carbon tax. It is difficult to forecast what final form that regulation may take; nonetheless, APS has included in its analysis the potential for carbon pricing in its 2017 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). The CO2 cost included in the IRP analysis was based on the California market Cap and Trade 2016 CO2 cost of $12.80, escalated at 2.5% beginning in 2023. Prior to 2023, APS's analysis assumed the CO2 cost to be $0. The carbon tax will continue to be integrated into future scenarios as we work with stakeholders on our new plan that is currently scheduled to be updated in the first half of 2020."}]}}

Exelon has a unique opportunity to support customer demand for transport electrification through our EV business model that leverages our exiting utility relationships to increase EV adoption. Increased use of electricity for transportation would increase demand for electricity, increasing the demand for power generation from our generating assets, as well as delivery services from our utilities. Also, since Exelon is a low carbon generation company, to the extent that this effort is done as a means of reducing GHG emissions, it could also more specifically increase demand for our low carbon generation portfolio. Examples of our involvement in EVs to lower community GHG emissions while increasing use of electricity include our investments in Proterra electric Buses and XL, the leader in connected fleet electrification solutions for commercial and municipal fleets. A few additional examples of specific utility actions in 2017 include ComEd's support for the Chicago Transit Authority e-bus initiative to add approximately 20 EV buses and accompanying charging infrastructure, BGE and PHI proposals in Maryland that would make the state a leader in advancing EVs on the East Coast and PECO's support for the Clean Transportation Infrastructure Act to increase transportation electrification usage by 50 percent by 2030. To position the local grid infrastructure for EV adoption, the utilities are also working with state regulatory agencies to ensure investments can be recovered and the grid remains resilient and reliable as new load is added to the system."}]}}

Being mindful of potentially differing priorities among our stakeholders, we spend significant effort analyzing strategic and operational options. We consider variables such as energy and environmental regulation, policy uncertainty (including climate), cost of renewables, cost of energy, demand for power, adoption of innovations such as Electric Vehicles, and impact of energy efficiency programs.We take appropriate measures and actions to comply with existing rules and regulations so as to protect our environment and the communities we serve. We manage our business with a commitment to sustainability, exercising disciplined cost management to meet our customers' expectations for affordability and reliability. We proactively communicate with our stakeholders on our compliance strategies through robust disclosure, shareholder engagement and regulatory !filings. And our strong governance framework demonstrates our commitment to oversight and accountability. Ameren is advancing our commitment to environmental stewardship though Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) issued in September 2017. The 2017 IRP is designed to ensure that customers' long-term electric energy needs are met in a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner.

Since 2010, for example, we have shared information about our sustainability programs and environmental commitment on our website and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) report, among other internal and external communications channels. Furthermore, we regularly present on and interview about PNC's green buildings, energy efficiency initiatives and environmental performance. Finally, we regularly meet and engage with our key stakeholders to ensure that our sustainability programs align with their interests and address their concerns. From a performance standpoint, we have significantly reduced our energy and water consumption and carbon emissions since 2009, when we established various environmental goals. Most importantly, we recognize the risk of carbon emissions and are constantly re-evaluating our risk management processes and procedures to ensure that our business can withstand changes in both our industry and natural environment."}]}}

For example, integrating climate change into advisory and consulting services is helping clients respond risks such as legislative, technological, legal, reputational, acute and chronic physical risks - and also provides revenue into our business. Climate change is therefore likely to both increase and/or decrease demand for certain products and services provided by JLL If we don't provide products and services that help clients respond to these risks, we will not be able to respond to market demand.

It is a phased approach that begins 7 days prior to landfall and focuses on protection of physical assets and employees before the storm. WM's plans have established standardized lines of communication and prearranged methods of communication post-storm to account for all employees, communication with customers and re-establishment of services. Each coastal site has a Waste Management Hurricane Plan in accordance with the Company's guidance document, which is then used to make site-specific plans. These change annually or more often based on area needs. After Hurricane Sandy, a WM competitor experienced $9 million in lost revenues. WM avoided this kind of loss and serviced the competitor's customers. After Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, WM expanded its emergency plan by making adjustments in facility design and IT capabilities. In 2016-2017 Sustainability Services was trained on severe weather safety and response, including best practices organizing a site safety plan with procedures and equipment. We updated hazardous materials emergency action plans, including continued natural disaster training, and training for all operational personnel. In 2017, these modifications are estimated to cost less than 0.05% of operating costs; profits from one storm event in one year exceeded $1 million."}]}}

It's impossible to predict demand, but if we assume demand for more efficient products and services drives a potential 1% increase in consolidated sales of services, we could estimate a potential annual revenue increase of more than $370 million. We calculated this based on our 2019 Business Solutions revenue of approximately $37 B. 1% of $37 B is >$370 M. (37,000,000,000 * 0.01 = 370,000,000) If our expectations are wrong and none of our customers find value in AT&T technology solutions that also reduce their GHG emissions, then financial impact could be as low as $0.

Eversource has teamed up with Denmark-based Orsted (formerly DONG Energy) on a joint venture to develop Bay State Wind, a proposed offshore wind farm that will be located off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, in an area that has the potential to develop at least 2,000 MW--enough electricity to power one million homes. Eversource and Orsted will seek to jointly develop, construct and operate this utility-scale offshore wind project in a 50-50 partnership. Orsted is the global leader in offshore wind, and will use its market leading expertise in the sector to lead the development and construction of the project's offshore generation and transmission assets. As the premier transmission builder in New England, Eversource will leverage its strong transmission expertise to develop and construct the onshore transmission system. Bay State Wind jointly owns a lease to develop a 300-square-mile ocean area located 15-25 miles south of the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The development of offshore wind in the Northeast is in its beginning phase and Bay State Wind will play an active role in its development.

Two members of U. S. Bank's legal department are part of the Environmental Working Group that drives climate related risk management initiatives and our formal risk management process includes a detailed review by corporate compliance who is well versed in current regulations. Current regulation that is included in our risk assessment is around renewable energy tax credits. The U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation is a leader in the renewable energy investment tax credit and community solar garden markets. Increased regulation, setting limits around the types of investments allowed under the tax credit, or a decrease in supportive regulation, such as discontinuing the tax credit at the federal level, in this area might lead to a reduced ability to make these types of investments. In 2018 U.S. Bancorp Community Development Corporation invested more than $1.1 billion in renewable energy. These investments helped add 1.5 gigawatts of solar power across the country, create 17,000 construction jobs, and produced an equivalent amount of renewable energy to power 240,000 homes. The carbon offset of these investments is equal to removing 377,000 passenger vehicles from the road or planting two million acres of forest."}]}}

Additionally Dow products in consumer solutions, polyurethanes and plastics provide value-added polymers and solutions that enable insulation, light-weighting, and food hygiene.Avoided emissions resulting from the use of Dow products are estimated as one of the targets for Delivering Breakthrough Innovations 2025 Sustainability Goal. Our target is to achieve three times the greenhouse gas benefit in use than the burden of producing it. We assess product families for the carbon benefit achieved through the use of the Dow product versus an incumbent alternative. The burden of production is approximated as the sum of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for the Company. We are still in the process of calculating this metric for all of the Dow portfolio, but the current estimate of the ratio of the carbon benefit of our products to the burden of producing them is greater than five. One of Dow's largest line of products with these benefits is plastic packaging. The calculation of the carbon benefits of plastic packaging products was based on the method defined in a report prepared for the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and the Canadian Plastics Industry Association (CPIA) by Franklin Associates."}]}}

For example, Macerich analyzed the Kings Plaza Facility to determine if it had resiliency to operate independently. The center itself has its own power plant, providing 12.8MW of combined heat/power through a CHP system. This stand-alone onsite cogeneration plant supplies 100% of the electrical requirements to the 1.2 million square-foot shopping mall and marina. The system is independent of Con Edison's grid, providing both electric and thermal energy to the center, and can maintain power through extreme events. Without this system in place, Macerich would most certainty be subject to negative effects from sudden storms, such as flooding, where access to Macerich properties could be mitigated, or even the loss of power, where tenant space cannot be utilized properly. Macerich also looks at grid connections and wielding all our capabilities throughout our portfolio, and including redundant utilities to ensure that all operations can operate, and battery backup power. Our risk assessment team along with our consultants, continues to monitor and assess this specific risk type. They meet every quarter to discuss development and address concerns."}]}}

Most importantly, we understand how the built form interacts and meets local green building regulations without unnecessarily limiting the choices, quality, or economics of the design. We stay abreast of changing regulations which can impact our business, such as increasingly strict building codes. For example, we have established a high-performance design group, Built Ecology, which has experienced strong demand for these specialist services. We have significant revenue streams through the provision of the certification of buildings through LEED, BREEAM and other sustainability standards across the globe.

Compared to our reported $900+ million in comparably supported new sales for FY18, we expect this opportunity to grow both new and existing business through sustainability factors, including our climate-related initiatives and investments. In particular, we are seeing increasing customer demand for more energy efficient products that reduce customer costs and carbon emission. Based on internally tracked HP data, energy-efficiency and/or eco-label certifications were the most frequent topic associated with HP customer requests for proposals (RFPs) and bids in FY19. This customer demand for energy-efficient products and services and presents an opportunity for HP to increase revenue from energy efficient product such as HP EliteBook 840 and the HP EliteDesk 800 small form factor desktops for which we have reduced the annual energy consumption by 47% and 40%, respectively, between 2011 and 2019. It also creates opportunity for HP service solutions that have a proven track record of reducing customer energy use, cost and emissions such as Managed Print Services (MPS). We conducted an LCA which demonstrates that compared to purchased printers, MPS reduces GHG emissions by 12%, improves resource efficiency by 13%, and decreases ecosystems impacts by 12% for a multifunction color laser printer. Key drivers include improved device efficiency and reduced materials use (higher duplexing rates and decreased paper waste). For example, HP Managed Print Services enabled Merck KGaA to reduce the number of printers by nearly 45% with a corresponding reduction in real-estate footprint, materials, power and management costs and CO2 emissions."}]}}

Worldwide demand for recycled scrap metal is driven primarily by steel production levels. Steel mill production using electric arc furnace (''EAF\") technology relies on recycled scrap metal as its primary feedstock. Steel mills around the world are the primary end markets for our recycled scrap metal.We collect and recycle autobodies, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap and construction and demolition scrap through its 97 auto and metals recycling facilities. We source material through well-developed, regional supply chains that collect scrap from large and small businesses and individuals. Our largest source of autobodies is our own network of 53 auto parts stores, which sell used parts recycled from salvaged vehicles and operate under the commercial brand name Pick-n-Pull. A majority of our auto parts stores are located in close geographic proximity to our regional metals recycling operations which have large-scale shredders and deep water port access. We process recycled metals ranging from iron and steel to aluminum, copper, lead, stainless steel and zinc for use in the manufacture of new products. With scrap recycling facilities located in 23 States, Puerto Rico and Western Canada, we efficiently collect scrap metal throughout North America and deliver recycled metal products to customers around the world from our seven deep water ports, and also to our own steel mill in Oregon.Our metals recycling facilities use shredding, sorting, and advanced extraction technologies to process salvaged ferrous and nonferrous metal into raw material of a uniform size and grade for reuse by steel mills and other new metal production globally. Our auto retail stores purchase approximately 350,000 end-of-life vehicles annually, sell more than 600 categories of used auto parts to customers locally, and export parts to used auto parts stores worldwide. We also sell parts that can be refurbished, such as alternators and transmissions, to remanufacturers, and we aggregate other parts that can be recycled, such as tires and batteries, to sell to dedicated wholesalers. Stripped autobodies are shipped to a metal recycling facility. Our steel manufacturing facility produces finished steel products using our recycled metal in our EAF steel mill. Compared with blast furnace mills that primarily use iron ore to make steel, EAF mills make steel more efficiently with scrap metal, requiring less energy and water, and generating significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions.Steel is the most recycled material on the planet, more than all other recycled materials combined. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that approximately 65 million metric tons of iron and steel scrap are processed around the world annually. Annually, the U.S. exports approximately 11.2 million metric tons of ferrous scrap to some 60 countries worldwide. Similarly, according to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, recycled nonferrous materials make up almost 10% of the total volume of recycled materials processed in the US. Annually, the U.S. processes more than 8 million metric tons of nonferrous scrap. The re-use of recovered and recycled materials (ferrous and non-ferrous metals in particular) is often considered one of the most effective and efficient ways to reduce consumption, and thus minimize negative impacts to the climate in manufacturing new materials. The metallurgical properties of most metals allow them to be recycled continually with no degradation in performance from one product to another. In 2008, and updated in 2016, research by Imperial College, London in the study \"Report on the Environmental Benefits of Recycling\" shows that recycling one metric ton of steel, ferrous metal, saves approximately 642 kWh of energy, 287 liters of oil, and 2.3 cubic meters of landfill space , when compared with the use and manufacturing of virgin iron ore.At Schnitzer, we aim to create value from recycling through sustainable practices that positively impact the communities in which we operate. Our business delivers sustainable value from recycling through reuse of auto parts from salvaged vehicles, by converting end-of-life materials into recycled metal products for new metal production by our external customers and by manufacturing finished steel from recycled steel materials. In fiscal 2017, the ferrous metal recycled by Schnitzer saved more than 8.47 million GJ of energy and avoided 3.57 million tons of CO2 being emitted, when compared with the use of virgin materials. This is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by 4 million trees over their 100 year lifespan and is more than 21 times the total global carbon footprint of Schnitzer (167,024 mtCO2e) for that year."}]}}

The new initiatives implemented during 2019 are estimated to reduce GHG emissions by 7,000 metric tons annually. (2) We use Hyatt's Sustainable Building Design and Construction guidelines to integrate efficiency measures in new construction and renovation projects.(3) Many hotels have conducted onsite energy audits to prioritize capital investments. (4) We engage our suppliers to address increasing risks within our supply chain. The collaborative relationship enables us to work closely with them as costs and other business considerations change over time. (Additional information on supplier engagement can be found in our response to Question C12.1a)These management methods cannot influence the likelihood of changes in the cost of raw materials and the associated risks, but they could reduce the potential magnitude of this risk's impact on our business at the present time and going forward.Cost of Management:Hyatt hotels invest in onsite energy audits, a critical step toward efficiency improvements and managing climate change risks. These audits typically cost between $10,000 and $20,000 per site.The management cost of $1 million dollars is estimated based on the number of full service Hyatt properties and frequency of audits."}]}}

(Technology , Acute physical , Chronic physical , Emerging regulation, Legal , Market , Reputation , Current regulation)\n\nAnswer: Stakeholder interest and expectations in climate change adaptation are increasing as the effects of climate change become more apparent, society is asking businesses to become part of the solution changing their practices. NGOs campaigns can impact companies' reputation and have business consequences on license to operate and bottom line.PMI is committed to combat climate change and set actions to act upon it. Those actions are conducive to substantiate PMI's leadership in sustainability as integral part of the success of its business transformation.Thus climate-related reputational risk is included into PMI's risk assessments considering the potential risk it could have on the long term success of the company.In 2019, the evaluation of climate change risks, aligned with TCFD recommendations, allowed for the identification of transition risks related to the reputation of PMI as a sustainability leader in the area of climate change; this evaluation included a survey of opinions of certain PMI stakeholders on how PMI contributed to or detracted from the transition to a lower-carbon economy.PMI identified that reputational risks can be driven by multiple factors including financial performance, investors' priorities, reporting requests, internal workforce concerns around sustainability, and challenges related to raising capital for the agriculture sector as a carbon intensive one.For example, PMI identified failure to address enhanced reporting requests as a potential reputational risk for the company. Increased reporting not only requires additional internal resources, but also exposes the company to a broader stakeholder community and sectoral benchmarking. PMI manages this risk by having an internal reporting team that coordinates reporting initiatives, as well as engagement with external consultants to ensure consistency through multiple reports, transparent communication, effective benchmarking against relevant sustainability ratings and the use of best practice methodologies and standards. We also conduct periodically a sustainability materiality assessment with a broad range of stakeholders. We strengthened our communication through our reporting. Our Integrated Report 2019, which covers our sustainability work, sought to align with the IIRC, GRI and SASB frameworks as well as with the recommendations of the TCFD and requirements of the CDP and other sustainability ratings; those documents and additional content can be consulted in our website."}]}}

These low-carbon energy purchases were voluntary and not in relation to external regulation. The purchases resulted in the reduction of the scope 2 market-based emissions included within our carbon neutral target. The expected lifetime of the purchase is one year and occurs in the year the green power was generated and accounted for by Microsoft (FY19, the reporting period for this response). We have only reported incremental REC purchases here per CDP guidance; however, this figure does not represent the full scale of the commitment that we have made to using green power, which for the reporting period reduced market-based scope 2 emissions by 2,607,999 mtCO2e from our location-based emissions."}]}}

Understanding and managing use-phase carbon emissions depends on realistic and repeatable power measurement. Cisco co-authored the ATIS TEER standard defining the protocol for characterizing the energy consumption of ICT equipment. - We believe that we have initiated prudent steps to address product carbon labeling/footprinting.

We also are working to develop new processes that allow our products to be made using less energy. Finally we are substituting remaining fossil energy with renewable energy.The first three principles of our renewable strategy are: 1. Utilize third-party capital to invest in renewable projects. Work with third-party investors and developers to implement national level renewable projects to supply renewable electricity via the grid or onsite projects which in both cases are based on long term power purchasing agreements. 2. We must retain all RECs and related environmental attributes from projects. Purchasing of unbundled RECs or Carbon offsets is not an approved method to achieve our target.3. We will create renewable projects targeting to obtain renewable energy at financial cost parity or better, with focus on mitigation of long term market risk compared to grid of fossil sources."}]}}

The impact of individual risks is assessed in the following areas: Health/Safety/Environmental, Operational and Reliability, Regulation/Legal/Compliance, Financial. Upstream risks related to climate generally include regulation, technology, legal, market and reputation risks. These are all factored into our risk assessment. For example, our utility SDG&E depends on power generators for approximately 77% of the power delivered to customers. We face risk if, for example, any of these facilities fail to generate the specified amount of power, which could be impacted by climate-related events such as extended drought. To mitigate these risks we require our suppliers of capacity, through the procurement process, to describe in detail how they will deliver on their contract with us in times of water or natural gas-related shortages. We also assign all risk and related costs associated with non-delivery of contracted electricity to our suppliers."}]}}

The city of Sunnyvale's transportation demand program requirement demands that businesses analyze their traffic and congestion impacts from employee transportation. Risks from this regulation are managed by the Environmental, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) department by monitoring regulatory changes in relevant jurisdictions and by maintaining existing programs and policies for compliance. To mitigate these risks, Juniper has in place programs and policies, including the EHSS Policy which outlines the company's commitment to environmental responsibility, as well as Juniper's Active Commute Rewards (formerly Bike to Work) program. In 2019, Juniper expanded the Active Commute Rewards (ACR) program to include more monetary and non-monetary benefits and incentives, and to include the employees at both our Bangalore and Amsterdam sites. Juniper's ACR program has seen a consistent increase in enrollments year over year, with nearly 100 new participants in 2019, and is one measure the company takes to mitigate the risk of being out of compliance for the state, county, and city policies. Because of these policies and programs, the transportation demand program requirement on Juniper's Sunnyvale headquarters has had little impact on operations, as the campus already offers alternative commute resources and programs to employees and has implemented a monitoring program to track progress. The cost of managing general environmental risks is equal to the cost of staff time and consulting services devoted to regulatory review, the cost of implementing green business programs (including tools and training), and costs of attaining certifications and verifications as needed.

In 2019, our Aptar teams completed the enhancement of our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) functionalities with an improved eco-design tool. The goal is to help product designers understand how components flow through the recycling and waste stream. The improvements allow for a more detailed view of product end-of-life. This enhanced tool now integrates LCA methodologies with recyclability assessment and material circularity indicators to measure how circular a product is. As an example, in 2019, Aptar teams in Europe used the eco-design tool to develop new closures for a market leader of sustainable household cleaning products. With help from our eco-design tool, the material selected for this launch enabled a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to previous generations and other design selections.Explanation of cost calculation: we have software modules to help us manage these eco-design topics. However, it is possible additional modules would need to be added as products require further evaluation. We are assuming a need for $0.5M in software costs, data, documentation & external support."}]}}

For example, the U.S. Department of Energy expects wind energy will grow as the U.S. looks to lessen dependence on fossil fuels. As one of the leaders in wind energy component transport, UP and our subsidiaries are uniquely positioned to support customers' efforts to power the country with wind energy because of UP's fully integrated network of trains, tracks and distribution centers. UP has transported nearly 50,000 wind energy components since 2006 and in 13 years the business grew from 0-unit trains to 184 in 2018. This equals approximately 5,300 wind turbines that can power about 1.8 million U.S. households. According to the American Wind Energy Association, the use of wind power tripled over the past decade. In order to transport goods safely and efficiently and develop new business, Union Pacific spent over $345 million on locomotives and other equipment and $585 million on new capacity and commercial facilities. To mitigate this risk, UP will develop continue to diversify and develop new renewable business. Assuming that 2% of the 2018 capital costs relate to new renewable business, the costs of management are $18,600,000. (2% * cost of new capacity and commercial facilities + cost of new equipment)."}]}}

The NextGen Cup Challenge will be open to supply chain leaders, innovators and solution providers that have promising solutions to recovery of single use cups, with a focus on the fiber based hot and cold cup, starting with creating a fully recyclable and/ or compostable cup in North America. While NextGen intends to work on the entire cup system, including cups, lids and straws, its first challenge will focus on the fiber-based hot and cold cup, as this is the most significant challenge faced by the industry. Each year, an estimated 600 billion paper and plastic cups are distributed worldwide. Most of these are not recyclable or compostable. The NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge launched in 2018 to bring together entrepreneurs, industry, and recyclers to identify and commercialize the next generation of recyclable and/or compostable cups. Closed Loop Partners, Starbucks, and McDonald's invite the industry to join this effort to identify a global solution to this shared challenge."}]}}

In conjunction with the Oracle Volunteering Focus on Environment initiative and Earth Week, Oracle hosts Green Fairs at several office locations globally. The purpose of these fairs is to engage and educate employees around Oracle's sustainability and climate-related initiatives. More than 1,800 Oracle employees attended the 2018 Green Fairs in and around Oracle's headquarters. Additionally, Oracle continued promoting the 'Sustainability Champions' program in 2018, through which we recognize employees who are advancing environmental sustainability at work and beyond. Oracle's 2018 Sustainability Champions included a group of employees that supported India's first large-scale behavioral energy efficiency pilot program for the residential sector late in 2018, enrolling 200,000 residential utility customers. The program aims to empower residential consumers to reduce energy waste, improve energy efficiency, and lower peak-hour consumption in India using Oracle Opower.

Our multi-brand strategy allows us to deliver a broad range of vacation ownership product and to pursue development opportunities in a wide range of destinations, including international and urban markets. Having a diverse brand portfolio means we can select the most appropriate brand and development partners to expand our footprint. Our vacation exchange business has relationships with over 4,200 vacation ownership resorts in approximately 110 countries and territories located in North America, Latin America, Caribbean, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. We tailor our strategies and operating plans for each region where we have, or seek to develop, a substantial member base.We also actively manage our energy consumption to mitigate risks associated with changing mean temperatures. We track our environmental footprint using a proprietary online environmental management system, which includes the ability to share dashboards that measure key performance indicators and goals across our portfolio of more than 36 million square feet. In New York City, where risks associated with urban heat islands have been identified, our Club Wyndham Midtown 45 resort - located in midtown Manhattan - is an active participant in the NYC Carbon Challenge. The Club Wyndham Midtown 45 resort has been recognized by the Mayor's office in New York as first in the vacation ownership sector, and second in the overarching hospitality industry, to achieve the Mayor's challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30%.Since 2010, we have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 32%, while increasing our overall portfolio square footage by 16%. At the asset level, property managers also engage in preventive maintenance to increase the resiliency of our resorts against changes in mean temperatures.COST CALCULATION: Annually, we invest approximately $10 million in resiliency investments and other expenses associated with our Environmental Sustainability pillar to manage this risk."}]}}

These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, California's cap and trade scheme, China's Emission Trading Scheme pilots, South Korea's Emission Trading Scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under the Canadian federal government, Alberta's Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation, and nation-wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs. Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHGs. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to electric power and industrial gas production. In addition, any binding agreement that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Air Products' facilities could impact our value chain and growth by increasing operating costs, both directly and through suppliers."}]}}

Therefore, we include the potential impact of climate-related events and the associated disclosure and communication process in the risk assessment and mitigation process. We also recognize that with increasing public and investor concerns over climate change, a lack of disclosure on how we identify and manage climate change risks could expose us to potential reputational risk. For example, over the past few years, there has been an increase in investor interest on environmental, social and governance factors, which includes responding to and mitigating climate risks. As a result, we have been strengthening the transparency and credibility of the information we publish publicly on climate-related issues, including concerning governance, risks, opportunities and performance. In 2019, climate-related disclosures were included in our 2019 Annual Report, Sustainability Report, Investor Fact Book and on our website."}]}}

The Government of Canada has proposed a national benchmark requirement of $10/tonnes of CO2 by 2018, which will rise by $10 each year to $50/tonne in 2022. As the details of the federal and provincial targets are nearing the end of negotiations the magnitude of impact to Nova Scotia Power is medium-high. Nova Scotia Power continues to be on track to transform the company from relying on fossil-fuel based generation to renewable generation and meet its renewable targets for 2020 and regulated GHG targets. The time horizon for this risk is short-term due to the 2018 Canadian CO2 benchmark timeframe. Nova Scotia Power is pursuing various renewable energy opportunities and has made one of the fastest transitions to renewable energy of any utility in Canada. We have tripled our renewable energy in 10 years. We have also created a website for our customers that shows real-time information about our electrical generation, specifically renewable generation."}]}}

In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Given that our agronomists, quality experts and buyers are on the ground working with coffee farmers every day, we see firsthand and hear directly about the impacts of climate change. In addition to increased erosion and infestation by pests and coffee rust, coffee farmers are reporting shifts in rainfall and harvest patterns that are hurting their communities and shrinking the available usable land in coffee regions around the world. The impact of climate change on farming communities is a key reason addressing our environmental impact is a priority for Starbucks. As a company that relies on an agricultural product, we are concerned about the impacts of climate change, especially in the sensitive bioregions where coffee is grown. Climate change is compounding other issues faced by coffee communities (deforestation, water shortages, decreasing yields, rainfall pattern changes) and the effects vary by region. As climate change continues to make it more challenging to grow coffee and reduces the area of land suitable for growing coffee, Starbucks is always assessing the implications of climate change on its core commodity. It has yet to have macro economic impacts on the cost of coffee, but Starbucks recognizes the impact climate change is having on coffee farming. One way climate change is altering the coffee landscape strikes at the core of what Starbucks considers its caffeinated lifeblood. High-quality arabica coffee with its diversity of flavors is the heart of Starbucks' business, but it's becoming harder to grow in sustainable quantities in the face of climate change. That's because arabica plants are particularly sensitive to even the slightest variations in temperature and rainfall patterns."}]}}

Car fleet emissions were determined by multiplying the distance each vehicle travels times a DEFRA (2018) emission factor (grams CO2/ km traveled). It is noted that the emission factor is a function of the engine displacement. Truck emissions were determined by multiplying fuel consumption (liters of diesel used by the truck fleet) times a published emission factor for diesel fuel (grams CO2/ liter of diesel). The emissions from offices, warehouses, car fleet and truck fleet were then added to yield the estimated emissions from this category."}]}}

Managed and franchised hotels included in this disclosure include: our luxury and lifestyle hotel brands, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, Conrad Hotels & Resorts and Canopy by Hilton; our full service hotel brands, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Curio - A Collection by Hilton, DoubleTree by Hilton, Tapestry Collection by Hilton and Embassy Suites by Hilton; our focused service hotel brands, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton by Hilton, Tru by Hilton, Homewood Suites by Hilton and Home2 Suites by Hilton. In addition to our current hotel portfolio, we are focused on the growth of our business through expanding our share of the global lodging industry through our development pipeline. During the year ending December 31, 2017, nearly 108,000 new rooms were approved for development, and we opened 399 hotels consisting of over 59,000 rooms.We depend on our long-term hotel management and franchise contracts with third-party owners and franchisees for the majority of our fee revenues. The management and franchise segment includes all of the hotels we manage for third-party owners, as well as all franchised hotels owned and managed by others. As of December 31, 2017, there was a total of 729 hotels managed by Hilton within the owned and managed global regions (\"managed hotels\"). Out of these hotels, Hilton has an ownership interest in 73 hotels (10% owned, joint venture, leased) and a 100% controlling interest in only four hotels, accounting for less than 1% of the total managed portfolio under Hilton's operational control (\"Direct Operations\"). Franchised properties, which are controlled by Hilton's development and operating standards for the respective Brands, account for over 73% of our global portfolio by total room count. Given their significance to Hilton's business model, responses that are relevant to franchised hotels are reported as Other Value Chain.Our 2018 CDP Reporting Boundary is Operational Control, defined as companies, entities or groups over which operational control is exercised. It is important to note that this represents a change from last year's reporting where Hilton has expanded its reporting boundary to include water consumption data for both managed and franchised hotels. This change was made in an effort to ensure consistency with our DJSI reporting and annual sustainability results published for our global portfolio. However, this caused other reporting inconsistencies and issues with the level of operational control and detailed data available for our franchised properties. Therefore, we have returned to the Operational Control Boundary for CDP reporting on Climate Change, Water and Forests to ensure consistency. However, please note that Hilton's corporate responsibility strategy, along with LightStay requirements for measurement and improvement in energy efficiency and emissions reduction, extend to all managed and franchised hotels globally.Hilton has integrated energy and climate-related issues into our business objectives for years through our continual focus on improving the environmental performance of our hotels and driving responsible travel and tourism across our industry. We are serious about our role in helping the international community reach the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through our global hotel operations and supply chain footprint. Our corporate responsibility strategy, Travel with Purpose, drives us to think and act in ways that will maximize our contributions to help meet these important global goals. In this spirit, we have united our 380,000 Team Members along with our owners, partners and communities in more than 100 countries around our corporate responsibility strategy and shared goals. Earlier this year, we released our new Travel with Purpose long-term commitment to double our social impact and cut our environmental footprint in half by 2030. One of the key targets underpinning these goals is our new science-based targets (SBTs), demonstrating our commitment to reducing our carbon emissions in line with the stipulations of the Paris Agreement. We believe that climate change is one of the biggest threats to business today, and we are proud to be the first major hotel company to have our SBTs approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."}]}}

These projects delivered annual energy savings of 136,000 MWh, equal to 3.2% of our total energy use during 2019 and surpassing the corporate goal of 3%. They also avoided 47,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions and saved $14.4 million in expense. The avoided emissions were equivalent to removing more than 10,000 passenger vehicles from the road during the year. In measuring performance against IBM's energy conservation goal, we only include the first year's savings from projects. Accordingly, IBM's total energy savings and CO2 emissions avoidance from these projects are actually much greater than this simple summation of the annual results. We do not include reductions in energy consumption resulting from downsizings, the sale of operations or cost-avoidance actions, such as fuel switching and off-peak load shifting, in our energy conservation results. The results reported were achieved through energy conservation projects in the following areas: virtualization and cooling efficiency in data centers; heating, ventilation and air conditioning projects; central utility plant efficiency projects; lighting efficiency projects; building controls projects; and other.

(Current regulation, Market , Acute physical , Upstream , Emerging regulation, Technology , Legal , Reputation , Downstream , Chronic physical )\n\nAnswer: The Science and Technology Committee of the Board of Directors makes recommendations regarding research and development objectives; reviews new developments and technologies; and oversees matters of scientific and medical integrity and risk management. There is increased interest in companies' sustainability performance and their action to mitigate environmental impacts. We have scientists working to discover new medicines that will help solve our world's greatest health challenges. This is particularly important as the impacts of climate change are threatening to affect the global spread and occurrence of infectious diseases. Lilly reinvests nearly a quarter of our revenue into research and development (R and D), one of the highest rates across all industries. These investments have allowed us to launch 10 new medicines in the last five years - including one in 2018 - and have up to 10 additional potential launches by 2023. We translated our R and D progress into strong business results in 2018. Lilly's revenue rose 7%, driven by our recently launched products. We explore innovations that can lessen the total negative environmental outputs which can result from production of a medicine. We support these through implementing green chemistry principles in R and D and end-product engineering, and by reducing the carbon footprint of our value chain and operations through our Product Stewardship Standard and Global Engineering Requirements. Some of our efforts include evaluating and incorporating alternative energy sources, new technologies, and best practices for energy use and GHG emission reductions; and implementing new manufacturing technologies which minimize environmental impact, such as continuous flow processes, which we have advanced in the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, we identified promoting cogeneration as an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions in our operations. This uses combustion to generate electricity on-site while also recovering usable heat. In 2018, we progressed the design and construction for a 9 megawatt combined heat and power system at our Puerto Rico facility (expected 2020 completion) resulting in anticipated energy savings of $6 to $7 million annually and approximately 15% reduction in site GHG emissions. We also operate combined heat and power systems in Ireland, Italy, England and Indiana."}]}}

This could require the vessels to call other ports which could decrease guest satisfaction and reduce revenue potential. As a global cruise company with world-wide itineraries, physical risks may exist for all areas transited by our vessels. The timescales over which the physical risks materialize is uncertain as the actual impact of natural disasters or adverse weather conditions is typically not known until after it has occurred. Changes in precipitation patterns can impact the ability to bring guests to affected areas. The amount of precipitation an area experiences, in the form of either flooding or lack of potable water could affect the health and safety of local people, our staff and our guests. This could result in us being unable to operate effectively in affected areas and may create a potential loss of revenues. Extreme weather events, for example hurricanes, have a very clear impact on the ability of our fleet to travel to locations in affected areas. Increased sea states or differing wind patterns lead to increased use of fuel, a significant cost impact, as ships need to be re-routed to avoid them. Likewise, changes or disruption to commercial airline services due to adverse weather can affect our ability to deliver guests to or from our cruise ships and thus increase our costs."}]}}

These are suppliers who have been identified as providing goods and services to CIBC that may associated with significant adverse environmental impacts. As part of the criteria detailed in our Environmentally Responsible Procurement Standard, these suppliers are required to complete a supplier questionnaire.Their response to the questionnaire is individually evaluated based on a scorecard where meeting environment-related criteria allows the supplier to achieve a weighted score. Areas we evaluate through the questionnaire include:- Environmental management systems;- Environmental initiatives and performance pertaining to their environmental aspects;- Environmental violations;- Product stewardship;- Support of responsible forestry practices; and- Third party certifications. The impact of this engagement is that the supplier's final score is incorporated into the decision making process through which we select our suppliers. Also, environment-related language is included in our contract with the supplier. Furthermore, it is through our evaluation process that we identify suppliers to engage with and support as they strive to improve their environmental performance. Post-selection of suppliers, CIBC continues to monitor suppliers' environmental performance as part of our overall supplier management process, including completion and subsequent re-scoring of the supplier questionnaire at a minimum of once every two years."}]}}

Current and emerging regulations and taxes are often applicable to businesses throughout our supply chain, which has the potential to result in increased costs of products and services. The impacts on the transportation sector have the potential to adversely impact our customers' travel frequencies and impact their decision to travel to certain places. Extreme weather may impact our suppliers' ability to effectively conduct business and trade, thereby increasing supply chain costs. Additionally, physical climate-related risks like changes in precipitation patterns and rising sea levels may deter owners from opening properties in locations that may be affected by such variability, and could increase insurance premiums for existing owners. Thus, upstream risks are relevant and always included in our climate-related risk assessment for monitoring the severity and velocity of these risks."}]}}

In 2018, our wind and solar deals, together with the RE that comes from the grid, produced enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our data centers and offices. In addition, we continue to deliver more and better services and products to more users using less energy and fewer emissions, as well as to operate our data centers and offices more efficiently (see: <URL>).Despite a significant increase in our total procurement of renewable energy in 2018 to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations, we have data centers in a few locations (i.e. Singapore) on grids where we are not able to source renewable electricity. Our operations at some of these sites grew last year, resulting in a slight increase in our total market-based Scope 2 emissions. This is the primary reason for this increase in emission intensity."}]}}

This is reported on quarterly to upper management, and annual performance towards this goal is reported annual to the public as part of our Corporate Sustainability Report. Exelon also monitors several other key metrics related to GHG emissions performance. These include customer abatement which are avoided emissions associated with our utility customer energy efficiency programs and RPS REC commitments; % line losses which is an indicator of the efficiency of our distribution system; and the emissions intensity of our merchant electric generation portfolio. Our generation emissions intensity is directly related to operational performance targets set for the operational capacity factor for our nuclear plants and capture rates for our wind and solar facilities. These target help to keep the importance of GHG mitigation and the transition to a clean energy economy in discussion throughout Exelon and a regular part of how we do business."}]}}

As a US EPA SmartWay Partner, UNFI stays up-to-date on fuel efficiency trends, indicators, and statistics. We are also implementing technologies such as a management information system that enables us to lower our inbound transportation costs by making optimum use of our own fleet of trucks or by consolidating deliveries into full truckloads. We also implemented changes that reduced our diesel usage and improved our fuel efficiency through a combination of behavioural changes (zero idling policies) and upgraded equipment. This includes regularly cycling our fleet, utilizing technology to optimize routes, transitioning to automatic transmissions, and upgrading trailer refrigeration units. As a 2018 example, we upgraded the majority of pre-2015 fleet, which can represent vehicle efficiency improvements of up to 50%, depending on the age of the vehicle before the upgrade. The cost of management is the capital investment for 8 projects implemented in 2016 (when data was last available) to reduce diesel usage. While this is not a yearly planned investment, it is an indicator of investments of these types that occur regularly. This is the best proxy since significant upgrades to fleet are not always additional operational costs, depending on the leasing contract structures."}]}}

Emerging technology, such as accelerated developments in alternate or low-emitting energy, has the potential to disrupt traditional business models for sectors such as energy generation from traditional sources such as oil, gas and coal. This could lead to increased credit or investment risk, due to increased likelihood of credit default and write-downs from stranded assets.

You are not assessing whether the answer fully satisfies the question, only whether the answer was intended to respond to that specific question.\n\nLabels:\n\n- [Yes]: The answer appears to be the original response to the question, as it aligns with the question's topic or intent.\n- [No]: The answer does not appear to be the original response to the question, as it does not align with the question's topic or intent.\n\nFormatting: Your answer should be formatted in this way to ensure consistency:\n```\nExplanation: [Provide a brief, clear explanation justifying the label chosen]\nLabel: [Insert Label]\n```\n\nExample of well-formatted answer:\n```\nExplanation: The answer provides a direct and relevant response to the question asked\nLabel: Yes\n```\n\nQuestion: Provide details of your products and/or services that you classify as low-carbon products or that enable a third party to avoid GHG emissions.\n\nAnswer: Our emissions reducing products and services encompass both emissions that are avoided through the use of our products and services by our customers (\"avoided emissions\") as well as emissions embedded in the products themselves (\"low-carbon product\"). Both types of emissions reductions are valued by our customers who have made public carbon reduction commitments. The absolute and relative magnitudes of avoided and embedded emissions will vary by product and we are in the process of applying both our own internal methodology and ISO standard 14067 (carbon footprint of products) to quantify both types of emissions over the product life cycle. Life cycle assessment results in conformance with ISO 14067 will be certified by a third-party critical reviewer. Examples of quantified emissions reductions include: modular gas processing at Nassiriya and Al Gharraf oilfields in Iraq will recover 200 million standard cubic feet per day of flare gas, reducing emissions by 5.7 million metric tons per year of CO2 equivalent. An additional net 3.9 million metric tons of CO2 eq. emissions reductions are possible annually if incremental power generation is fueled by natural gas, displacing oil; the LM9000 gas turbine delivers a 50 percent longer maintenance interval, 20 percent more power and 40 percent lower NOx emissions, resulting in 20 percent lower cost of ownership for LNG customers; the Integrated (offshore) Compressor Line operates with zero emissions; flare.IQ allows refineries and petrochemical plants to reduce flaring-related emissions by up to 12,100 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per flare annually. If deployed globally, flare.iQ could reduce annual emissions by 190 million metric tons of CO2 eq.; Intercept modular CO2 capture reduces emissions by 16,200 metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually per 4 engine pad or 60 percent compared to the no-capture scenario. In addition, because CO2 is captured near the well site, emissions are avoided from not having to transport liquid CO2 from a remote location to the well site."}]}}

(Technology , Acute physical , Chronic physical , Emerging regulation, Legal , Market , Reputation , Current regulation)\n\nAnswer: Discussions in FY2019, resulted in climate change being identified as an emerging business risk in the FY2020 Deloitte Global Enterprise Risk Framework. As such, the Enterprise Risk Management group proactively monitors the risk of climate change impact across the organization, connects with subject matter specialists to better understand climate change as an emerging risk, and performs risk sensing. Climate change is included in a list of emerging risks that are communicated to all Deloitte member firms twice a year for review, in an annual refresh report and in an updated report. Climate change as an emerging risk spans the entire organization. Deloitte Global has commenced work to be able to report in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Change-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In working through the TCFD recommendations increased discussion were held between Deloitte Global Internal Sustainability and Deloitte Global Risk around climate change risk. Work for reporting in alignment with TCFD recommendations is in progress and further information will be forthcoming. An example of risk within current regulation is Deloitte US' compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.223-22 Public Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Reduction Goals-Representation. Compliance with the regulation includes publicly disclosing greenhouse gas emissions and is mandatory if more than $7.5 million or more in Federal contract awards are won in the prior fiscal year. Due to the amount the Deloitte US member firm receives in federal contract awards, Deloitte US complies with this regulation; a failure to do so would result in a compliance and reputational risk."}]}}
