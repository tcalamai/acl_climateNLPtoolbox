To reduce the reliance on traditional fuel and increase the use of modern and renewable energy sources, the National Energy Policy (2009) was\ndeveloped with a set of goals targeted at maximizing efficiency, minimizing costs and adverse environmental impacts as principle of extending energy access to all Liberians.\nMost recently, Liberia's Initial National Communication (2013) reinforces the National Energy Policy with additional long-term targets and related activities, which includes:\n* Reducing GHGs by at least 10% by 2030\n* Improving energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2030\n* Raising share of renewable energy to at least 30% of electricity production and\n10% of overall energy consumption by 2030\n* Replacing cooking stoves with low thermal efficiency (5-10%) with the higherefficiency (40%) stoves.\nThe long-term strategy of Liberia is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The strategic\noptions for mitigation considered under the INDC are the energy sector (electricity,\ntransport) and the waste sector. The Waste Sector focuses on solid waste disposal on land.\nIn 2000, the waste sector accounted for about 0.60% of Liberia's national total CO2 eq\nemissions. A significant subcategory is CH4 emissions from solid waste disposal sites\n(SWDS) on land, which contributed 91.7%. CH4 mitigation targets will include landfill\nrecovery, waste incineration with energy recovery, composting of organic waste,\ncontrolled wastewater treatment, and recycling and waste minimization."}]}}

PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fossil fuel-rich Russia may not be known as a leader on climate action - but in the country's remote far east, authorities have launched an unexpected experiment: an effort to try out carbon trading and reach net-zero planet-heating emissions by 2025.\nThe government of the Russian island region of Sakhalin, in the Pacific Ocean north of Japan, is planning tax breaks, charging stations and dedicated parking lots for electric vehicles, alongside a ban on all petrol and diesel cars by 2035.\nCoal-fired power plants will be replaced with somewhat cleaner natural gas and hydrogen-fuelled passenger train lines developed in the region the size of Ireland, Sakhalin officials said, after their net-zero roadmap was approved by Moscow.\nThe Russian government - which has been criticised by green groups and analysts for setting unambitious climate action goals - in January gave a green light to Sakhalin's proposal for a pilot carbon emissions trading scheme, a first for the country.\nThe economy of the Sakhalin region, home to about half a million people, is largely based on fossil-fuel extraction, including coal.\nAccording to its net-zero plan, an inventory of Sakhalin's greenhouse gas emissions and natural carbon sequestration potential will be carried out by August, before setting up an emissions trading system to start operating in mid-2022.\n\"This experiment will allow us to try various measures to regulate carbon and evaluate their effectiveness, for later scaling up at the national level,\" Russia's Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said in an official statement.\n\"We hope that investors interested in 'green' projects, and companies willing to take on more ambitious climate targets, will be motivated to participate in the experiment,\" he added.\nSakhalin Deputy Prime Minister Vyacheslav Alenkov told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the region had taken the lead on the initiative, hoping to increase its investment appeal, improve quality of life and help solve environmental problems.\nBesides emissions trading and expanding electric mobility, the region also wants to swap coal for lower-emitting natural gas, develop blue and green hydrogen production, and promote sustainable management of its extensive taiga forests.\nAbout 97% of all coal mined there is currently exported, and coal could remain a reserve fuel for Sakhalin, if technologies were introduced to make the industry cleaner, Alenkov said.\nISLAND RENEWABLES?\nAs well as boosting gas for transport and homes - used now by about one-third of residents - there are plans to develop renewable energy, especially on the Kuril Islands, he added.\nAs the mountainous Sakhalin region is made up of nearly 90 islands, it is suitable for small-scale hydro, wind and solar power as well as geothermal energy, sources that are still under-developed but could improve energy access, Alenkov said.\nAn assessment of the opportunities for renewable solutions, including the technologies and funding needed, is due to yield its first results this year and investors are already interested, he added.\nSakhalin also hopes to develop cooperation with other emissions trading systems, including China, Japan and perhaps the European Union, and have its carbon credits approved for the international airline CORSIA offsetting scheme, Alenkov said.\nGeorgy Safonov, a climate policy researcher at Moscow's Higher School of Economics, said Sakhalin had high potential for bioenergy and renewables, urging the authorities to craft more robust plans for clean energy including green hydrogen, as well as to expand electric transport and forest carbon sinks.\nFILE PHOTO: Ravens fly over solar panels at the Abakan solar electric station owned by Russian electricity firm EuroSibEnergo of En+ Group, in a suburb of the Siberian town of Abakan, in the Republic of Khakassia, Russia September 26, 2017. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin\nNATIONAL AMBITION LOW\nVladimir Chuprov, head of Greenpeace Russia's energy programme, said Russia was 10 to 15 years behind global trends in regulating carbon emissions.\n\"It is only now we are getting to what many other countries have already realised,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBut as Russia's national emissions target does not require any real reductions, it will be difficult to build a nationwide carbon market due to a lack of demand for offsets, he added.\nA draft of new carbon regulation legislation, which has been worked out over the last four years, does not include a carbon tax or a national emissions trading system, after heavy lobbying from industry, he noted.\nRussia joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in September 2019, but its current climate policies and targets are way out of line with the pact's goal to limit global warming to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial times, according to research coalition Climate Action Tracker.\nRussia's draft long-term low-carbon development strategy, due to be approved this year, is considered by many experts as unambitious, as it does not foresee reaching carbon-neutrality any time before mid-century.\nThe country's first emissions target under the Paris Agreement, approved by President Vladimir Putin last November, aims for a minimum 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 1990 levels, including the carbon stored in and released from forests and other ecosystems.\nBut Russia's emissions are already about 30% lower than 1990 levels, without taking forests into account, and just over 50% lower if they are included.\nThe economy ministry also said in late 2020 the focus for near-term climate policy would be energy efficiency measures, incentives and support for companies to invest in emissions-cutting projects, and an updated methodology to measure forest carbon.\nPlans, announced last month, set a new target to increase energy efficiency by 30% from 2019 levels by 2030, after a previous 2020 goal was missed by a long way.\nThe new target will enable Russia to reduce its carbon emissions by almost half by 2030 from current levels, Deputy Minister of Economic Development Ilya Torosov told journalists.\nAlexey Kokorin, director of WWF-Russia's climate and energy programme, said the Sakhalin experiment was possible because oil and gas companies in the region, including Shell, are keen to shrink their carbon footprint and start producing carbon-neutral LNG as part of the Sakhalin-2 project by purchasing offsets.\n\"The experiment is certainly good, but Russia also needs to reconsider its national emissions reduction target and make its climate commitments more ambitious,\" he added."}]}}

Getting Dexus to net\nzero is an opportunity to align with\nchanging customer sentiment and\nmeet the increasing investor demands\nfor low-carbon investments.\nWe have made great progress on our\ngoal already and have brought forward\nour target to achieve net zero emissions\nto 30 June 2022, advancing our original\n2030 goal by eight years. Accelerating\nour net zero ambition delivers strong\nclimate action for our planet, enhances\nour vision and customer proposition\nfor smart, sustainable workspaces\nand ensures we will be ready for other\nopportunities, including supporting our\ncustomers on their own journey.\nOur commitment to deliver net zero\nemissions by 30 June 2022 will be\nachieved by:\n1. Our transition to 100% renewable\nelectricity from base building\noperations from July 2021, purchasing\nrenewable energy in the form of\nLarge-scale Generation Certificates\nor GreenPower\n2. Continuing to invest in certified\ncarbon offsets for our remaining\nemissions. We will purchase\naccredited nature-based offsets to\naccount for emissions from natural\ngas, wastewater, refrigerants, and\nwaste/recycling\n3. Verifying we are net zero and\nmaintaining this status through\nAustralia's Climate Active carbon\nneutral program\nIn parallel with this transition, our focus\nremains on improving energy efficiency\nand accelerating the deployment of\non-site renewables (see pages 56-57).\nTransitioning to 100% renewable\nelectricity will account for around\n80% of scope 2 and 3 emissions, with\nthe remaining 20% of scope 1 and 3\nemissions to be balanced through\ncarbon offsets.\nThis includes emissions for the base\nbuilding sources comprising electricity,\nnatural gas, diesel, refrigerant leakage,\nwater and wastewater, and waste and\nrecycling. It excludes tenant sources\nsuch as tenancy electricity.\nEnriched Environment continued\nOur approach on this journey involves:\n- Reducing or eliminating emissions at\nsource through efficiency practices and\nemission-free energy\n- Investing locally, prioritising Australianbased projects with a geographic\ncorrelation to the location of our\nproperties to support those local\ncommunities\n- Being transparent and verifiable, by\ninvesting in certified renewable energy\nand offset schemes, and certifying\nand disclosing our outcomes with\nindependent verification\n- Making a difference in Australia's\ntransition, by supporting supply chains\nand the development of renewable\nenergy and abatement projects\nIn line with the Oxford Offsetting Principles,\npublished by the University of Oxford,\nwe will shift towards 'nature-based'\ncarbon removal projects over emission\nreduction projects due to their ability\nto actively reduce atmospheric carbon\ndioxide. Initially we will invest in carbon\nremoval projects such as tree planting\nand bush regeneration projects, which\nuse photosynthesis to capture and\nsequest carbon from the atmosphere. As\ntechnologies develop, we will also transition\ntowards projects that provide higher\npermanence or long-lived carbon capture."}]}}
