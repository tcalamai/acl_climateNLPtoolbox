(Enbridge)   Re:  DEEP\u2019s Notice for Written Comment on Hydrogen Opportunities    Introduction  Enbridge Inc. (Enbridge) appreciates the Department of Energy and Environmental  Protection\u2019s (\u201cDEEP\u201d) robust consultation with industry and other stakeholders and for  giving Enbridge the opportunity to provide comments as it relates to DEEP\u2019s notice for  written comment on hydrogen opportunities issued on March 18, 2022.Enbridge is a leader in hydrogen, and this is illustrative of the way our company is  deeply engaged in the energy transformation underway today.We\u2019ve taken deliberate  steps to diversify our business to include lower emission energy sources like natural gas  and renewables, and we\u2019ve made early and strategic investments in low-carbon  solutions, including hydrogen, renewable natural gas (RNG) and renewable self-power.Enbridge believes that the world must find new ways to meet the dual challenge of  meeting global energy demand and addressing climate change.In our view, the answer  lies in finding and pursuing multiple pathways to provide affordable and reliable energy  with strong environmental performance.We believe that innovation can and should  happen across the entire energy system.Meeting this dual challenge will require more  renewable energy, cleaner oil and natural gas, and low-carbon fuels like hydrogen and  RNG.As the world transitions to a lower-emissions energy future, hydrogen will play a  vital role in decarbonizing many sectors, including medium and heavy-duty  transportation, residential and commercial heating, power generation, and hard-to  decarbonize industries such as ammonia and steel.Hydogen is a promising opportunity, particularly in the pursuit of cleaner natural gas.As  the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy future, natural gas will play a vital role \u2013  as a replacement fuel for coal in electricity generation, a low-carbon source of home  heating, a lower-emission fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and large transportation fleets,  and a complement to the growth of renewable energy.Through deeper decarbonization,  hydrogen and RNG amplify the already positive role natural gas is playing in the energy  transition.We\u2019re proud to lead our sector in the energy transition space, and there are more  exciting opportunities to come, with the proper strategy and conditions in place."}]}}

governor  should  have  to  explain  how  hundreds  of  millions  in  annual  RGGI revenue would  be  raised  without  tax  increases.State  Sen.  Ghazala  Hashmi  (D)  argues  that the  lost  dollars  would  leave  desperately  needed  flood  control projects  unfunded.\\nHashmi  \u201cis  absolutely  against\u201d  withdrawal  and  is  urging  Youngkin  to  understand  \u201chow  vital  it  is  to  remain  within  the  RGGI  compact,\u201d  said  June  Laffey,  Hashmi\u2019s  chief  of\\nstaff.\\nLaffey  noted  that Virginia  in  December  awarded  $24.5  million  in  grants  from  its  Community  Flood  Preparedness  Fund,  using  RGGI  funds,  to  help  communities  build\\ntheir  capacities  to  address  climate  impacts  and  combat  effects  of  severe  weather,  recurrent  flooding,  and  sea  level  rise.\\nVirginia\u2019s  potential  withdrawal  from  RGGI  creates  uncertainty  for  Dominion  Energy,  the  state\u2019s  largest  utility,  which  purchased  millions  of  allowances\u2014costing  more  than  $100 million\u2014to  cover  its  2021  emissions.\\nDominion,  which  opposed  the  state  joining  RGGI,  remains  concerned  it  will  \u201cresult  in\\na  financial  burden  on  its  customers  with  no  real  mitigation\u201d  of  regional  emissions,  company spokesman  Rayhan  Daudan  said.\\nTremors  in  Pennyslvania\\nPennsylvania  had  to  overcome  significant  political  opposition  toward  joining  RGGI  sometime  in  2022.But  its  fate  may  depend  on  its  next  governor  to  succeed  Gov.Tom  Wolf  (D),  a  big  RGGI  proponent who  is  term-limited and departs  in  January  2023.\\nRepublicans  who  control  both  of  Pennsylvania\u2019s  legislative  chambers  have  come  within  striking  distance  of  forcing  the  state  out  of  RGGI,  but  Wolf has  won  each  round,  including  a  Jan.  10  veto  of  a  resolution  to  dismantle  participation.\\nBarring  unforeseen  changes,  Pennsylvania  is  expected  to  begin  participating  in  the  second  or  third  quarter  of  2022  after  clearing  regulatory  hurdles  in  2021.\\nRGGI\u2019s  opponents  aren\u2019t  giving  up.They\u2019re  mulling  strategies  to  scrap  or  limit  Pennsylvania\u2019s  participation,  from  getting  a  Republican governor  elected  in  the  fall  to  passing  legislation  to  boost  resilience  and  other climate  funding\u2014as  long  as  the  state  ends  its  RGGI  participation.\\nSeveral  Republican  candidates\u2014including  former  U.S.  House  Rep.  Lou  Barletta  and  Jason  Richey,  a  partner  with  K&L  Gates  LLP\u2014strongly  oppose  RGGI.Even  the  leading  Democratic  candidate,  Attorney  General  Josh  Shapiro,  whose  office  ultimately  signed\\noff  on  the  regulation  in  December,  has  at  times  sounded  skeptical  on  the  campaign\\ntrail.\\nPennsylvania  needs  an  energy  strategy  that  ensures  reliable,  affordable  and  clean  power  for  the  long  term,  \u201cand  it\u2019s  not  clear  to  me  that  RGGI\u201d  does  so,  he  said  last  fall.\\nLegislative  Alternative\\nPennsylvania  legislators  are  considering  legislation  that  could  offer  an  alternative  to  RGGI,  possibly  by  investing  money  in  climate  change  adaptation,  mitigation,  and  technology,  according  to  state  Sen.  Joe  Pittman  (R).Lawmakers  are  considering  language  to  prevent  Pennsylvania  from  joining  RGGI  unless  all  13  states  that  rely  on  the  PJM  regional  transmission  system  also  join,  Pittman  said.\\n\u201cThat  would  at  least  level  the  playing  field  in  terms  of  making  sure  our  status  as  an  exporter  of  electricity  is  maintained,  because  all  states  would  be  treated  equally,\u201d  Pittman  told  Bloomberg  Law.\\nSome  Democrats  also  support  a  legislative  fix,  including  state  Rep.  Pam  Snyder  (D),  who  told  Bloomberg  Law  that  joining  RGGI  \u201creally  puts  a  burden\u201d  on  Pennsylvania\u2019s  energy  sector.\\nIf  all  else  fails,  there\u2019s  always  the  courts.RGGI  opponents  are  exploring  the  idea  that  joining violates  Pennsylvania\u2019s  Air  Pollution  Control  Act  and  imposes  an  unconstitutional  tax.\\nAnother  possible  legal  argument  would  be  that the  state\u2019s  environmental  regulators\\ndidn\u2019t  follow  state  law  when  holding  virtual  hearings  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic.Opponents  argue  the  unavailability  of  broadband  service  in  some  parts  of  the  state  means  the  virtual  option  violated  public  hearing  requirements.\\nOne  final  strategy:  Pennsylvania  GOP  lawmakers  could  get  enough Democrats  to  defect  to  hit  the  two-thirds  threshold  they\u2019d  need  in  both  chambers  to  overturn  Wolf\u2019s  veto  of  the  RGGI  withdrawal  resolution.\\nOvercoming  those  odds  in  the  Senate  is  possible,  said  Mark  Szybist,  a  senior  attorney  with  the  Natural  Resource  Defense  Council\u2019s  climate  and  clean  energy  program;  odds  are  tougher  in  the  House.\\nBut  opponents  don\u2019t  \u201chave  much  to  lose  by  doing  it,\u201d  he  said.\\nEnforceable  Limit\\nUnder  the  initiative,  participating  states  set  an  enforceable  regional  limit  on  the  amount  of  carbon  pollution  that  power  plants  are  allowed  to  emit  and  sell  pollution  permits  up  to  the  limit  through  quarterly  auctions.\\nIn  addition  to  Virginia,  Connecticut,  Delaware,  Maine,  Maryland,  Massachusetts,  New  Hampshire,  New  Jersey,  New  York,  Rhode  Island  and  Vermont  participate.\\nRGGI  generates  dollars  state  can  leverage  into  even  more  funding  via  the  federal  infrastructure  package  and  Democrats\u2019  proposed  Build  Back  Better  legislation,  EDF\u2019s  Warner  noted.Virginia  raised  more  than  $200  million  in  its  first  year  for  state  energy  efficiency  and  flood  protection,  she  said.\\n\u201cWe  are  already  seeing  dollars go  out  the  door  now,  and  these  projects  are  being  supported  by  members  of  both  parties,\u201d  she  said,  including  GOP  districts  demanding  flood-protection  dollars.\\nOfficials  with  the  RGGI  program  declined  to  comment,  noting  the  outcome  for  both  states  remains  unclear.But  its  backers  say  its  expansion  into  those  and  other  states\\nwill  be  paramount  if  congressional  deadlock  over  climate  action  continues,  including  Biden\u2019s  stalled  Build  Back  Better  package.\\nTo  contact  the  reporters  on  this  story:  Dean  Scott  in  Washington  at  dscott@bloombergindustry.com  ;  Stephen  Lee  in  Washington  at  stephenlee@bloombergindustry.com\\nTo  contact  the  editor  responsible  for  this  story:  Rebecca  Baker  at  rbaker@bloombergindustry.com\\nTo  read  more  articles  log  in  .\\nLearn  more  about  a  Bloomberg  Law  subscription"}]}}

allowances through a 10% reduction per year starting in 2026.This would, if implemented, contribute to a very significant  shortage in free allocation in the second trading period of Phase  IV, therefore increasing the carbon costs ArcelorMittal will face.This could result in the Company incurring significant additional  costs to acquire emissions allowances, the purchase of which  may or may not be effectively hedged in the future.The financial  impact of any reduction or phase out of free allocations will also  depend on the timing of the implementation of changes (itself  dependent on political and regulatory developments), and the  Company\u2019 s parallel progress in decarbonization, the cost of  which may also be higher than currently expected.In addition,  the effectiveness of the CBAM proposal against carbon leakage  is untested and the provisions to address circumvention risks,  including resource shuffling and cost absorption seem  insufficient.No assurance can be given as to the timing or  adoption of such proposal or its implementation.\\nIn addition, as regulators and investors increasingly focus on  climate change issues, the Company is exposed to the risk of  frameworks and regulations being adopted that are ill-adapted  to its operations.For example, the most established framework  for carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes is currently  the European Union's ETS discussed above.As mentioned  above, the Company has highlighted the importance that a  CBAM be included in this system in order to avoid competitive  distortions such as European steel becoming overpriced due to  European carbon policy, prompting the market to outsource its  steel from other regions where carbon is less expensive.With  respect to investors, the European Union has reached a political  agreement on a package of measures to implement key actions  with respect to its sustainable finance plan, and, in June 2020,  the European Commission published the EU Taxonomy for  Sustainable Finance, a unified classification system to define  what can be considered an environmentally sustainable  economic activity, as a step in the efforts to channel investments  into sustainable activities by making it clearer which economic  activities most contribute to meeting the EU's environmental  objectives.The Taxonomy Delegated Act on climate mitigation  and adaptation criteria is effective as of January 1, 2022 but  Delegated Acts for the four other environmental objectives are  still pending.A proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting  Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d), which envisages the adoption of EU  sustainability reporting standards to be developed by the  European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (\u201cEFRAG\u201d), with  such standards to be tailored to EU policies building on and  contributing to international standardization initiatives, is to be  adopted by October 2022.The SEC has also indicated that it  plans to adopt new climate change disclosure requirements.If  the standards or requirements adopted are not appropriate for  the Company or if investors, financial institutions or other\\nstakeholders, including the public, begin to view investments in  steel and mining as undesirable, it may become more difficult  and/or more expensive for the Company to obtain financing.While the Company has taken significant steps and continues to  adapt its operations in light of climate change and the need for  sustainability, such steps may not be in line with future  frameworks or regulations or market views of investment  suitability.Moreover, the Company may in the future face  increasing shareholder activism and/or litigation in relation to  sustainability matters.See also \u201cThe Group\u2019s carbon emissions  intensity reduction targets are based on current assumptions  with respect to the costs, government and societal support for  the reduction of carbon emissions in particular regions and the  advancement of technology and infrastructure related to the  reduction of carbon emissions over time, which may not  correspond in the future to ArcelorMittal\u2019s current assumptions  and may render its targets more costly, more difficult, or even  impossible, to achieve\u201d.For further information on  environmental laws and regulations and how they affect the  Company's operations, see \u201cBusiness overview\u2014Government  regulations\u2014Environmental laws and regulations\u201d and note 9.1  to ArcelorMittal\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\\nThe income tax liability of ArcelorMittal may substantially  increase if the tax laws and regulations in countries in  which it operates change or become subject to adverse  interpretations or inconsistent enforcement.\\nTaxes payable by companies in many of the countries in which  ArcelorMittal operates are substantial and include value-added  tax, excise duties, profit taxes, payroll-related taxes, property  taxes, mining taxes and other taxes.Tax laws and regulations in  some of these countries may be subject to frequent change,  varying interpretation and inconsistent enforcement.Ineffective  tax collection systems and national or local government budget  requirements may increase the likelihood of the imposition of  arbitrary or onerous taxes and penalties, which could have a  material adverse effect on ArcelorMittal\u2019s financial condition and  results of operations.In addition to the usual tax burden  imposed on taxpayers, these conditions create uncertainty as to  the tax implications of various business decisions.This  uncertainty could expose ArcelorMittal to significant fines and  penalties and to enforcement measures despite its best efforts  at compliance, and could result in a greater than expected tax  burden.See note 10 to ArcelorMittal\u2019s consolidated financial  statements.\\nIn addition, many of the jurisdictions in which ArcelorMittal  operates have adopted transfer pricing legislation.If tax  authorities impose significant additional tax liabilities as a result  of transfer pricing adjustments, it could have a material adverse  effect on ArcelorMittal\u2019s financial condition and results of  operations.\\nManagement report 34"}]}}
