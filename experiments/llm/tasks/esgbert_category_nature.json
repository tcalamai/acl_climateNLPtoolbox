Also, sentences displaying direct impacts on water issues are considered like droughts.\nForest: The forest topic comprises direct effects on timberland, trees, wood consumption, and related ecosystems. Also, the indirect effects of monocropping, and overharvesting leading to deforestation are considered. Additionally, working conditions, corruption, and bribery around the topic of forests are important.\nBiodiversity: Biodiversity topics address the variety of living species on Earth, including plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi. A special focus lies on animal life in natural habitats and ecosystems. Categories of human interventions could be nature pollution, destruction, or restoration. Furthermore, special attention lies on hotspot areas of biodiversity loss. Hot spots may be coral reefs, rainforests, or other tropical areas.\n[No Nature]: Not related to nature (meaning water, forest or biodiversity). Simple generic environmental issues are not enough.\n\nFormatting: Your answer should be formatted in this way to ensure consistency:\n```\nExplanation: [Provide a brief, clear explanation justifying the label chosen]\nLabel: [Insert Label]\n```\n\nExample of well-formatted answer:\n```\nExplanation: The sentence discusses the effects of deforestation which directly relates to the Forest topic.\nLabel: Nature\n```\n\nInput text: 17 Dogwood Realty, LLC, which was established to hold commercial real estate acquired as a result of loan workouts."}]}}
