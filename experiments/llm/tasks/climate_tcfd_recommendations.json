These events may increase our capital and operating costs to maintain and/or repair our facilities following the event. Every year we make significant investments in real estate and net- work maintenance and upgrades to build resilience into our operational infrastructure. Based on the lessons learned during storms such as Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Michael, we have taken steps to increase the resilience of our network in affected areas and other at-risk areas. Depending on the area and risk, these steps to enhance infrastructure resilience have included adding stilts to raise equipment that powers cell sites, moving site generators from basements to a higher level or platforms, and installing new fiber solutions underground rather than using aerial fiber. We also have ongoing efforts to improve backup facility power systems, including power capacity at facilities located in areas with greater storm and wildfire risk, by adding generators to at-risk sites where, historically, the site only had backup batteries. Federal, state, and local regulators may create requirements that change the type and timing of actions we take, which could result in higher operating costs than anticipated."}]}}

Many consumer goods companies purchase commodities, like palm oil and soy, through supply chains that originate in rainforests in places like Indonesia and Guatemala. Deforestation is a principal driver of climate change, responsible for roughly 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Extensive--and oftentimes illegal--deforestation can have devastating impacts on biodiversity and on local and indigenous communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods. Deforestation has also been linked to severe human rights violations and, in recent years, environmental campaigners and protesters have been arrested and killed in record numbers."}]}}

Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict - may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include the economic, financial, and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; the ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks or data security breaches) on the Bank's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud to which the Bank is exposed; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank's use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance and the Bank recapitalization \"bail-in\" regime; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; environmental and social risk; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank's credit ratings; changes in currency and interest rates (including the possibility of negative interest rates); increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank's results. For more detailed information, please refer to the \"Risk Factors and Management\" section of the 2020 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the headings \"Significant Events\" in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on <URL>. All such factors should be considered carefully, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, when making decisions with respect to the Bank and the Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank's forward-looking statements."}]}}

We continually invest in our estate, updating and integrating new energy-efficient features and equipment across our sites. - Our environmental management system provides a framework to help us oversee our environmental responsibilities effectively and meet our targets. Our offices are accredited to ISO 14001:2015 - an international standard. - The recent purchase of our Bristol office, The Core, saw environmental considerations central to the design. LED lighting, new chillers, heating, ventilation and an air conditioning system have made the site more energy efficient. As a result, running costs for our estate in Bristol are now 55% lower than they were in 2016. - We procure a 100% renewable electricity tariff through our partners at Engie and have done since 2014. We are in the process of applying for membership to RE100, a global initiative dedicated to accelerating a global shift in clean energy, under which we will continue our objective of sourcing 100% renewable electricity. In addition, we are increasingly enabling and encouraging flexible working and reduced business travel, leading to further reductions in Scope 3 emissions under our direct control. - Approximately 200 of our people do have jobs that require a car, and a number of others have an optional car lease benefit as part of their compensation. In August 2020, we announced an improved car scheme policy to encourage our people to make better decisions for the environment, including more hybrid and pure electric vehicle options. For cars that are company funded, the Group will also cover the costs of the installation of a charge point where an electric vehicle is chosen. - We have invested in a network of Environmental Champions across all our office sites and a growing network across our repair centres, all of whom have received accredited sustainability training. Our Environmental Champions work to engage colleagues and promote local awareness campaigns, as well as working with the local property teams to deliver local initiatives designed to reduce our environmental footprint. These initiatives are particularly focused on energy efficiency and waste. In addition to the reductions in energy usage across our estate, we also recycled 98% of our total waste in 2019 along with 100% of office waste being diverted from landfill."}]}}

Most of Linde's energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. Linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. Large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. Such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact Linde's financial condition or results of operations. The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where Linde conducts business. However, regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk."}]}}

For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company's sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers' premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model."}]}}

For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of 7.27% was derived based on the target asset allocation of 40%-60% equity securities (approximately 8.5% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 5.3% expected return) and 5%-15% alternative investments (approximately 6.8% expected return). For the international plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of 15%-25% equity securities (approximately 6.1% expected return), 30%-50% fixed income securities (approximately 4.8% expected return), and 30%-50% alternative investments (approximately 5.2% expected return). For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent 10- year period ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 9.2%. For the international plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately 7.0%. Changes to plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return. For 2020, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.00% for the U.S. plans. Expected weighted average returns for international plans will vary."}]}}

Through the programme, we impart awareness on the applications and benefits of using plastic, addressing common misconceptions and negative perception about this material. We also addressed the issue of waste management focusing on clean-up activities with the community at selected rivers and beach. This include regular workshops, talks and gotong-royong activities which impart the know-how on waste segregation at home and keeping the environment clean. These initiatives reached out to more than 2,700 participants and volunteers. ecoCare is PCG's flagship environmental conservation initiative, run in collaboration with the Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) since 2005. Being the first environmental education centre in the East Cost of Peninsular Malaysia, it promotes awareness on the importance of mangrove ecosystems in protection of biodiversity as well as coastal terrain. Through ecoCare, we engage local community volunteers in carrying out conservation and rehabilitation activities. In 2019, more than 6,300 mangrove trees and seedlings were planted, while the ecoCare Environmental Education Centre (EEC) attracted more than 4,000 visitors."}]}}

We continue to target reduced energy consumption through a variety of initiatives and the new targets were set. It is encouraging to note that own generation from renewable sources remains steady at 668 MWh for 2020. Overall fossil-fuel-based electricity consumption per FTE was reduced through less occupancy due to Covid-19 lockdown regulations and our ongoing facilities consolidation project. The result is that the overall energy (electricity) consumption was reduced by 11,50% year on year to 3 963 kWh per FTE (2019: 4 477 kWh per FTE) for the period under review. The major focus for future energy reduction initiatives remains on implementing the lessons from our campus sites to drive similar reductions across our non-campus sites."}]}}

The adidas Stakeholder Relations Guideline specifies key principles for the development of stakeholder relations and details the different forms of stakeholder engagement. adidas participates in a variety of industry associations, multi-stakeholder organizations, and non-profit initiatives. Through these memberships, we work closely with leading companies from different sectors to develop sustainable business approaches and to debate social and environmental topics on a global and local level. We use collaborations and partnerships to build leverage for systemic change in our industry, such as for strengthening chemical management practices and raising standards in the cotton supply chain. In addition, we build awareness, capacity, and knowledge of laws and rights among factory management and workers by partnering with leading providers such as the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Better Factories Cambodia program, as well as with the United Nation's International Organization for Migration with the objective to ensure that the labor rights of foreign and migrant workers are upheld in the adidas supply chain. > ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/PARTNERSHIPS <URL>"}]}}

In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. Lastly, consumers and customers may put an increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations."}]}}

This includes physical risks related to the chronic and acute physical impacts of climate change (e.g., shifts in climate norms, and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires and floods), and transition risks associated with the global transition to a low-carbon economy (e.g., climate-related policy actions and litigation claims, technological innovations, and shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services). Both physical and transition risks could result in strategic, credit, operational, legal, and reputational risks for the Bank and its clients in climate sensitive sectors. TD supports Canada's objectives to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and recognizes the Bank's responsibility to contribute by integrating climate considerations across its business. The Bank continues to monitor industry and regulatory developments and assess the potential impacts of climate change and related risks on its operations, lending portfolios, investments, and businesses."}]}}

They also include one-time gains and losses, significant impairments, restructuring charges and other items that are not in the normal course of business or a result of day-to-day operations recorded at various times over the past eight quarters. These items are excluded from adjusted earnings and are highlighted below: * In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, Canadian Utilities closed a series of transactions related to the sale of its Canadian fossil fuel-based electricity generation business and Alberta PowerLine resulting in a gain on sale of operations of $125 million after-tax. As these transactions are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings. * In the second quarter of 2020, impairment and other costs not in the normal course of business of $30 million after-tax were recorded. These costs mainly relate to certain assets that no longer represent strategic value to the Company. As these costs are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings. * In the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company signed a Master Services Agreement with IBM Canada Ltd. (IBM) to provide managed information technology services. These services are currently provided by Wipro under a ten-year MSA maturing in December 2024. The Company has recognized costs of $55 million after-tax, which represents management's best estimate of the costs to exit the Wipro MSA. The actual costs are expected to be finalized later in 2021. As these costs are one-time in nature, they are excluded from adjusted earnings."}]}}

On a semi-annual basis, the Risk Management department conducts a survey with all members of the Core Leadership Group (CLG), Extended Leadership Group (ELG) and Global High Potential Group (GHIPO) to ensure an effective bottom-up identification of risks and opportunities. Risk Management has also defined 25 categories to help identify risks and opportunities in a systematic way. In addition, adidas uses various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative and quantitative research including trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our business partners and controlled space network. These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis. Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups and product styles which show most potential for future growth at a local and global level. Equally, our analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or changing consumer tastes. Furthermore, as part of our identification process, we monitor physical risks related to climate change as well as risks and opportunities resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Our risk and opportunity identification process is however not only limited to external risk factors or opportunities, it also includes an internal perspective that considers company culture, processes, projects, human resources and compliance aspects."}]}}

As corporate citizens that follow the UN SDGs, companies must perceive their roles and promote the relevant matters with an active mindset. Governance should be improved as well. In particular, LG Chem must disclose information transparently and establish a clear stance. Since LG Chem is the best and leading chemical company in Korea, its stakeholders will ask for flawless corporate management. LG Chem should feel proud and responsible at the same time because the society has great expectations for the company to meet the highest level of ESG regarding the rights of shareholders, safety and health of workers, health and privacy of consumers, and fair trading. The recent safety accident was probably inevitable due to the business characteristics, but LG Chem should remediate the situation swiftly and systematically and come up with a solid measure to prevent recurrence.

We have also witnessed a plethora of pledges from both companies and politicians to tackle climate change, but real, decisive action supporting the pledges to reduce emissions has yet to surface. The uncomfortable truth is that our entire economy is based on fossil fuels, and therefore moving to a low-carbon future will affect all sectors. Furthermore, having emitted the bulk of the emissions to achieve economic growth and raise living standards, the West finds itself in the Janus-faced position of asking the developing world to reduce their emissions and perhaps by extension limit their ability to deliver growth and lift people out of poverty."}]}}

We first ventured into specialty chemicals in partnership with Dow Chemical Company, setting up the Optimal Group of Companies to produce performance and specialty chemicals including glycol ether and ethoxylates, among others. In line with the second prong of our growth strategy, we subsequently deepened our presence in the specialty chemicals market through the development of our Integrated Aroma Ingredients Complex under our joint venture company, BPC. This was followed by investments in 2-EHAcid and HR-PIB plants, all of which are the first of their kind in Southeast Asia, putting us ahead of the curve in the regional specialty chemicals market. These growth projects began commercial operations between 2016 and 2018."}]}}
