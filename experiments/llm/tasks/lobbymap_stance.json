Support for 95% AFUE - Canada .There has been significant debate amongst stakeholders\nin regard to challenges associated with mandating condensing only (90%+ AFUE) furnaces, including both venting and condensate disposal.DOE spends a significant portion of the TSD discussing these issues.We acknowledge that several existing applications will have a higher burden with a condensing only standard, including those with furnaces located in potentially cold spaces such as attics and crawl spaces.Other applications may have challenges with venting, such as orphaned furnaces or running new PVC venting for the condensing furnace.However, we note that Canadian regulations mandated condensing only furnaces (90% AFUE) ECS over a decade ago in 2010.Canadian ECS was increased to 95% in 2019.Stakeholders in Canada have figured out how to address these issues, and U.S. stakeholders have the same capability to overcome such challenges.\nD. Support for 95% AFUE - Environment .With global concerns of climate change, and\nefforts to protect our environment, setting a higher ECS is justifiable.In Chapter 14 of the TSD, DOE addresses \"Monetization of Emissions Reduction Benefits,\" which address societal concerns with greenhouse gas emissions.Daikin supports initiatives to address climate change, decarbonize and electrify where possible and where reasonable.Like so many other countries, states, organizations, and companies, Daikin has environmental goals to move toward a more sustainable lifecycle of our products.As noted in our\nQuery: Is the organization supporting policy and legislative measures to address climate change: energy efficiency policy, standards, and targets?"}]}}

from our supply chain to our own operations to the use phase of our products.On May 24, 2022, Siemens Energy hosted its Capital Market Day in Berlin, where we announced our aspiration to reach net zero across the entire value chain, in line with a 1.5degC pathway.Central to this is our target to become climate neutral in our own operations by 2030.\nIn 2021, the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) validated the absolute GHG reduction targets for GP, not only for our own operations (Scope 1 and 2), but also for the use phase of our sold products (a category of Scope 3).This confirms that our targets are in line with the Paris Agreement.\nThe SBTi also verified that SGRE's emissions reduction targets (Scope 1 and 2) are aligned to meet the 1.5degC Paris Agreement goal.SGRE achieved cli- mate neutrality in its own operations in 2019, including offsetting unavoid- able emissions.It plans to achieve its Scope 1 and 2 neutrality without off- sets in 2030 by:\n* Applying energy reduction, substitution and efficiency measures * Drawing electricity supply from renewable sources * Switching to green mobility to reduce fleet emissions * Increasing awareness campaigns and collecting employee ideas\nSGRE now aims to go beyond carbon neutrality to become a carbon sink (carbon positive) in its own operations by 2040, for example by cultivating CO 2 -absorbing microalgae.Additionally, SGRE seeks a zero-emission supply chain by 2040.For further information please refer to SGRE Consolidated\nNon-Financial Statement 2022, C.2 Climate Change .\nIn meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement, we are also helping to meet the climate and energy targets of the European Union (EU).As part of its European Green Deal, the EU has implemented a classification system -

L\n\"Decarbonized hydrogen will play a key role in reducing emissions, particularly in the hard-to-electrify sectors of the global economy, and agreements like this one will ease the transition as markets increasingly move to lower-carbon fuels,\" the Hydrogen Forward coalition said in an emailed statement.\nBuilding pipelines for hydrogen transport initially would allow much greater use of the fuel, going beyond existing goals to blend modest amounts of it into gas as a way of reducing power plant emissions, said David Burns, Linde's vice president of clean energy development.\n\"If you're going to build new pipeline, you'd build it hydrogen-ready so it meets the specifications and requirements for hydrogen,\" Burns said.\"You can't turn from one day using LNG to the next day using hydrogen,\" but even at LNG export facilities there are ways to \"build in flexibility,\" he said.\nThe U.S.-EU approach is consistent with the vision of many natural-gas producers that see production of hydrogen as a way to buttress long-term demand for their fossil fuel.\nYet the green bona fides of hydrogen depend on how it is produced.\nThe vast majority of hydrogen generated today is stripped from natural gas with steam in a technique that releases planet-warming carbon dioxide.The process can be made cleaner by trapping that carbon dioxide on site, and plugging leaks of methane, but there's a near emission-free alternative using electrolysis to split hydrogen molecules from water.Truly \"green hydrogen\" plants that use electrolysis to generate the fuel are powered by renewable energy.\nThe U.S. and EU reiterated their climate goals Friday, saying they're committed to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\"Natural gas remains an important part of the EU energy system in the green transition, including by ensuring its carbon intensity decreases over time,\" they said in the statement.\nQuery: Is the organization supporting an IPCC-aligned transition of the economy away from carbon-emitting technologies, including supporting relevant policy and legislative measures to enable this transition?"}]}}

( NRG) Q1 2022 Earnings Call\nCorrected Transcript\n06-May-2022\n1-877-FACTSET <URL>\n4\nCopyright \u00a9\ufe0f 2001-2022 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\ndevelopment for our customers in two areas, Energy Services and Home Services.Today, I want to focus on one area of growth that I'm especially excited about, energy resilience.Goal Zero is our home energy resilience and storage company and has been part of NRG since 2014.When we acquired the company, their primary focus was to serve a niche market of outdoor enthusiasts and while they were a market leader in that space, the total addressable market was limited.Recognizing that extreme weather events and power outages were only going to increase given climate change and an aging power grid, we shifted the company's strategy to address energy resilience head on.Today, Goal Zero's energy resilience products are clean, accessible and affordable.Their power stations and solar generators are modular and portable, meaning they can provide resilience to any apartment, residential home or recreation vehicle of any size, something a gas generator or rooftop solar system cannot do.They're also scalable, enabling customers to design a resilient solution that can expand in the future, therefore balancing budget and need.Importantly, these products cost a fraction of what a standby gen set or rooftop solar system cost fully installed, which allows us to serve an even broader customer base.And they require minimal installation.These are just some of the reasons why customers love Goal Zero products, giving them a net promoter score above 70, a rating that is typically reserved for best-in-class brands.In the last three years, Goal Zero has grown revenue at a 50% CAGR and gross margins of around 40%.While the overall revenue and gross margin of the business today remains small compared to the core operating platform, the energy resilience market is expected to grow at 50% CAGR through 2025.And we expect Goal Zero to grow along with it.And this is before considering external factors that could potentially drive growth even higher.For example, last December, California announced a ban on gas generator sales beginning in 2028.Such policy decisions by local and state governments will only increase demand for Goal Zero's products.The team is already working on the next generation of solar power generators that will launch in 2023 with a focus on storage technology upgrades, enhanced home integration and a better digital customer experience.I look forward to providing you updates on their progress as we bring new products to market and integrate these solutions closer with our core energy offerings.So with that, I will pass it over to Alberto for the Financial Review...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Alberto Fornaro Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, NRG Energy, Inc.\nThank you, Mauricio.I will now turn to slide 9 for a review of the first quarter results.For the quarter, NRG delivered $509 million in adjusted EBITDA, a $58 million decrease versus prior year excluding the impact of Winter Storm Uri in 2021.Results were reduced by $50 million for the divestiture of 4.8 gigawatts fossil generation assets in the East and West and the Whole Home Warranty business.In addition, the lack of availability of Limestone Unit 1 in Q1 2022 and other outages impacted negatively the quarter.Excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been higher than Q1 last year and this strong result is driven by our diversified portfolio allowing us to deliver through inflationary pressures and commodity price volatility.I'm also pleased to report the total impact of coal constraints has been limited to-date.In Texas, lower power prices helped mitigate the overall coal requirement versus expectations.And in the East, we were able to procure more than what we initially estimated.Looking forward, while we have seen overall improvements in the availability of coal, the US railroad delivery network remains fragile.And so, while we have made progress in mitigating the realized financial impact of the constraints, we continue to tightly manage our coal burn.Moving to Q1 results by geography, Texas results were in line with prior year when factoring in the previously discussed plant outages.Turning to the East, West and Other segments, as in prior quarters, we were able to leverage our portfolio of natural gas assets to deliver strong results through a volatile market.These benefits were offset by the impact of the previously discussed divestiture of generation assets and Whole Home Warranty business.We continue to make good progress in our synergy target, delivering $31 million in incremental\nQuery: Is the organization supporting an IPCC-aligned transition of the economy away from carbon-emitting technologies, including supporting relevant policy and legislative measures to enable this transition?"}]}}
