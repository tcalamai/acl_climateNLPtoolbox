Your task is to label the provided input based on the criteria outlined below.\n\nTask: You will be presented with a text that contains a fallacious argument. You must classify the argument in one or more of the following fallacy types:\n\nLabels and Definitions:\n\n- [faulty generalization]: Faulty Generalization - An informal fallacy wherein a conclusion is drawn about all or many instances of a phenomenon on the basis of one or a few instances of that phenomenon. This is an example of jumping to conclusions.\n- [false causality]: False Causality - A statement that jumps to a conclusion implying a causal relationship without supporting evidence.\n- [circular reasoning]: Circular Claim - A fallacy where the end of an argument comes back to the beginning without having proven itself.\n- [ad populum]: Ad Populum - A fallacious argument which is based on affirming that something is real or better because the majority thinks so.\n- [ad hominem]: Ad Hominem - An irrelevant attack towards the person or some aspect of the person who is making the argument, instead of addressing the argument or position directly.\n- [fallacy of logic]: Deductive Fallacy - An error in the logical structure of an argument.\n- [appeal to emotion]: Appeal to Emotion - Manipulation of the recipient\u2019s emotions in order to win an argument.\n- [false dilemma]: False Dilemma - A claim presenting only two options or sides when there are many options or sides.\n- [equivocation]: Equivocation - An argument which uses a key term or phrase in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument.\n- [fallacy of extension]: Fallacy of Extension - An argument that attacks an exaggerated or caricatured version of your opponent\u2019s position.\n- [fallacy of relevance]: Fallacy of Relevance - Also known as red herring, this fallacy occurs when the speaker attempts to divert attention from the primary argument by offering a point that does not suffice as counterpoint/supporting evidence (even if it is true).\n- [fallacy of credibility]: Fallacy of Credibility - An appeal is made to some form of ethics, authority, or credibility.\n- [intentional]: Intentional Fallacy - A custom category for when an argument has some element that shows intent of a speaker to win an argument without actual supporting evidence.\n\nFormatting: Your answer should be formatted in this way to ensure consistency:\n```\nExplanation: [Provide a brief, clear explanation justifying the label chosen]\nLabel: [Insert Label]\n```\n\nInput text: \" This has been the saddest research trip of my life \""}]}}
