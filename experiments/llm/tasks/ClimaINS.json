new emissions reporting obligations; and different regional emission reporting requirements, like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, present an indirect risk to ACE These various regulations have resulted in companies that are focused on reducing emissions and/or generating emission credits under the mechanisms created by said regulations These emission reducing/credit producing projects encompass an enormous variety of technologies, some proven, some more experimental Many of these projects are located in the developing world, and the regulatory and financial framework underpinning these projects continues to undergo rapid development As a result, these projects present a unique risk profile with heightened technical, political and financial risk, which ACE assumes through its insurance products Lastly, ACE is among the largest and most advanced global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risk, with ACE Environmental Risk units in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Typical cover includes premises-based exposures, contractors and project pollution liability, professional liability, and an array of cover for environmental clean-up projects As part of the potential insured\u0092s evaluation process when seeking an applicable environmental risk transfer products, ACE considers emerging trends when finalizing contractual terms and conditions as well as pricing As regulations evolve to include GHGs, there is an increased risk to ACE is clients cannot comply with new regulations\n\nIndirectly, due to the fact that our company provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may become more frequent or severe due to climate change, ACE experiences risk through its clients Specifically, related to precipitation extremes and droughts, the areas exposed are property and crop coverage, which collectively comprise approximately 28% of our gross written premium annually The risk is that actual losses in a given year may exceed the underlying underwriting and actuarial assumptions used to price products, thereby eroding profitability and, in extreme circumstances, shareholder capital Also, radical changes in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, could jeopardize or potentially eliminate certain ACE markets through physical damage, price escalation and/or regulatory activity In addition, changes in climatology or local weather patterns may generate unpredictable patterns in hurricanes/typhoons or severe localized events such as freezing, flooding, tornadoes or hail Such unpredictability could negate the use of actuarial techniques and undermine our ability to price and risk-manage price offerings As a global property and casualty insurer, ACE is exposed to potential losses from various types of weather-related events In particular, natural catastrophe related losses are reported annually and as needed for extraordinary events or periods In 2014, ACE recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $291 million compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $230 million in 2013 \n\nIn ACE\u0092s own operations, offices in strategically important locations could be affected by physical risks For example, ACE\u0092s offices in New York and Philadelphia represent two of the largest regional operations in North America, with more than 1,900 employees and several of the company\u0092s senior executives ACE\u0092s offices in Hamilton, Bermuda, are the headquarters for the company\u0092s ACE Tempest Re and ACE Bermuda subsidiaries, as well as several corporate executives The Singapore office serves as the headquarters for ACE\u0092s 14-country Asia-Pacific region and houses several regional executives and a multi-country telemarketing operation Specifically, as precipitation patterns change and the severity and consistency of storms increases, there is an increased chance of flooding or snow accumulation that could affect ACE employees by limiting their abilities to commute to the office or affect ACE offices by causing power outages ACE has developed a business continuity framework to respond to any incident, including those related to climate change that may disrupt business operations, regardless of the size, scope or cause \n"}]}}

more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a person\u0092s vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions\u0094\nIn the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:\n1\tPrimary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;\n2\tSecondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and\n3\tTertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate change\u0096related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)\nWith regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 2001\u00962002 (71%) to 2013\u00962014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories\nWith regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level\nWith regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: \u0093Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems\u0094\n"}]}}

specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) Chubb\u0092s modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation \u0096 and hence price differentiation \u0096 across our client base Clients that mitigate risk \u0096 through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains \u0096 will have lower insurance costs than those that do not Chubb also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior \n\n\nThe company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For Chubb to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital \n"}]}}
