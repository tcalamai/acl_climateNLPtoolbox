Sustainability Council that convenes on a broad range of environmental issues\nOur Investments Team comprises investment professionals across assets classes that include public and private fixed income, real estate, commercial mortgage lending and common stocks\nInvestments: At Sun Life, our investment practices adopt a long-term view, and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations when reviewing investment opportunities Investments are made after thorough research and analysis, which includes looking at a variety of relevant factors and assessing the long-term sustainability and growth of the companies and opportunities in which we invest\nOur robust investment processes are designed to consider and manage numerous investment risks, including relevant ESG risks We identify material macro changes in the environment and evaluate companies' changing strategies to determine whether they've adequately identified disruptions and opportunities As these risks are identified, they are factored into our investment strategy, which is continually re-evaluated, and enables us to appropriately position our portfolio\nOur Investments Team has established multiple systematic processes to help identify potential macro changes through top-down and bottom-up analysis For example, the senior members of the Investment Team attend quarterly strategy sessions where a wide range of topics are debated including current environment, economic and market forecasts, and other concerns or opportunities including, as appropriate, industry specific events The North American energy industry was a feature topic at a 2013 strategy session\nFixed income: Our Credit Analysts in our Public Fixed Income Team are responsible for monitoring companies and industries globally They are responsible for determining the appropriateness of an investment in a particular issuer, and for evaluating information on macro trends or industry shifts They regularly hold in-depth sector reviews Investments employees from the other asset classes are invited to attend these sector reviews For any macro economic or regulatory changes that we determine to be of potential environmental impact, we hold specific cross asset class discussions to share information and formulate our strategy, as well as to ensure that we are properly identifying any potential secondary risks For Private Fixed Income investments where the primary security is real estate, an important aspect of the underwriting process is an assessment of the security for existing and potential environmental risks\nThe Company also has in place an International Sustainability Council composed of senior representatives from key, relevant functions such as risk management, investments, finance, human resources, legal, public affairs, and shared services (including procurement and global facilities management) The International Sustainability Council periodically reports progress relating to sustainability to the senior executives of the Company The International Sustainability Council meets bi-monthly and is finalizing a new sustainability policy, which includes reference to climate change\nIn general, our Enterprise Risk Framework sets out processes for risk appetite identification, measurement and assessment, response development, monitoring and control, and reporting and communication The framework recognizes the importance of risk culture in effective enterprise risk management Our risk culture is well-defined and embedded in our day-to-day business activities All business segments employ a common approach to identify, measure and assess risks, evaluate potential correlation between various risk events and categories, and monitor emerging risks and industry developments We have a process to identify and monitor emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation Management provides various risk reports to the Board, its committees and management committees including the Risk Review and Executive Risk Committees\nIn general, all risks are considered as part of our Enterprise Risk Framework Enterprise risk ranking and heat map covering all risks are presented at the Risk Review Committee and Executive Risk Committee on an annual basis On a quarterly basis, a key risk report, which includes the enterprise heat map and commentary thereon, is presented to the Risk Review Committee and the Executive Risk Committee and highlights key risks in current business plans and mitigating action plans New products or any product initiative where risk is assessed as high or extreme require a risk assessment to be submitted to the Chief Actuary and the Chief Risk Officer (all risks are in scope) The assessment includes a comparison to the Company's desired risk appetite and profile Finally, risk mitigation options are developed and assessed\nOur risk appetite is aligned with our overall corporate vision, mission and business strategy This alignment is obtained by the consideration of key risks that we are willing to accept in order to achieve a certain level of return, and successfully achieve our stated mission to \"help customers achieve lifetime financial security\" and our business objectives These key risks include insurance risks, market risks, credit risks, liquidity risks and operational risks and we have established a range of explicit risk appetite limits and operational control points for these risks\nWe seek to allocate our risk-taking capacity in a manner that optimizes the overall level of risk-adjusted returns and stakeholder value creation Budgeting of risk-taking capacity is managed through the application of risk limits and the embedding of strong risk management discipline into a wide range of key management decision-making processes"}]}}

and in the case of a partial or full loss, their policies will cover replacing systems and materials or rebuilding according to the latest standards for energy efficiency and certified green buildings Other unique aspects of our commercial green policies include coverage against lost financial incentives- such as tax incentives, utility discounts and special loan rates - and the cost of recertification after a covered loss Commercial vehicle fleet owners are offered an upgrade policy whereby Fireman's Fund replaces traditional vehicles with hybrids following a total loss Similar policies are available for homeowners and personal auto lines\nSustainable manufacturing, certified green commercial building and homeowner policies are all eligible for premium discounts - recognizing that responding to climate change risks and reducing losses is a shared benefit for insurers and their policyholders\nCorporate & Specialty Solutions\nAllianz Global Corporate & Specialty offers similar green building policies to its clients, while focusing on a variety of specialized industry solutions such as a machinery upgrade coverage that enables its Marine Insurance clients to replace major engine parts with new parts that meet the latest energy efficiency and environmental standards in case of modification, damage or loss\nAllianz offers other specialized climate and energy related products in the US and global markets, including: coverage for a shortfall of carbon reduction certificates associated with a physical loss to low-carbon power generation; a product that protects against the revenue downside of wind and solar power installations, if the yield is lower than the agreed upon deviation compared to the forecasted energy yield (for example due to reduced wind/sun or a lower capacity than the minimum stated by the associated technology manufacturer); and weather index -based insurance wherein Allianz and the customer agree upon a predetermined event to trigger the coverage (based on weather risk, such as extreme temperature, rainfall, wind, frost, hail and/or snowfall), with payout calculations that incorporate price and revenue elements\nEuler Hermes offers bonds (\"surety\") for corporate clients in wind power, hydro power, solar energy, biomass, biofuel sectors - to support the construction, completion and operation of renewable energy facilities\nRisk Advisory & Dialogue\nIn addition to innovative insurance coverages, Allianz companies can leverage their position as expert and trusted risk managers to help policyholders respond to climate change Fireman's Fund uses its \"Green Risk Advisor\" platform in conjunction with targeted outreach to small business and homeowners to educate customers on the broad value and risk reduction of green building measures, and continues to target commercial clients by presenting on green risk reduction measures at forums like The Conference Board, the Corporate Responsibility Officers Association, the Urban Land Institute, etc\nFireman's Fund's Green Commercial Risk Management and Loss Control Services assists policyholders in identifying solutions to control rising energy costs, decrease carbon emissions, increase profitability and reduce risks and losses - thus helping customers make their properties more sustainable, so they can meet business objectives while reducing their environmental impact This includes risk services consultants who can help commercial property owners benchmark their buildings' energy and water consumption with EPA Energy Star's Portfolio Manager tool, to identify under-performing buildings and set related investment priorities, develop energy management goals, and track performance and savings over time\nFireman's Fund also works closely with The Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), and other partners to engage policyholders in support of loss resiliency measures and disaster preparedness These efforts relate closely to climate risks such as Wildfires, where for example, IAFC has helped define \"Ember Zones\" and Fireman's Fund risk service consultants then recommend various measures that can be taken to safeguard a home from wildfire and prevent embers from entering a home Fireman's Fund also supports the efforts of IBHS and others to link green building and disaster resiliency - including in building codes - and has made this a key focus of Fireman's Fund's agenda as the first and only insurer nominated to the US Green Building Council's board of directors\nSimilarly, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty engages its policyholders on climate change -related risks directly through its expert risk consulting services, and more broadly through various publications and forums including Expert Risk Articles, white papers and case studies, and bi-annual Global Risk Dialogues that have recently covered topics like natural catastrophe preparedness for risk managers from construction to marine industries, opportunities and limits for how AGCS clients utilize natural catastrophe models, and risks and opportunities for energy sector clients at the forefront of the shift to renewable energy, smart grid and infrastructure modernization, etc\nIn 2012, AGCS placed particular emphasis on helping policyholders understand and manage supply chain risks - including those related to climate change Allianz Risk Consulting - part of a worldwide network of more than 260 of some of the insurance sector's most seasoned risk engineers across all major industrial sectors - assist clients by improving their resilience to disruption through the identification of potential exposures within both their internal and external supply chains In response to rising supply chain disruption losses, AGCS decided to engage its customers in solution-oriented dialogue instead of reducing capacity, thus working together to understand risks and accumulation potentials and ultimately developed new solutions like \"Non-Damage Business Interruption\" coverages while helping our clients, rating agencies and financial authorities better understand risk accumulation In 2012, AGCS published a report entitled \"Managing Disruptions: Supply Chain Risk - An Insurer's Perspective\" that examines the complexities of supply chains, how natural catastrophes and other perils are increasingly putting them at risk, and what that means for both insurance and industry The study investigates how industries can make supply chains more resilient and outlines the evolving role insurers should play in the process In recognition of all of these programs, the editorial team at Global Finance's 2013 ranking of the World's Best Supply Chain Finance Providers selected Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty as the best insurance provider for supply chain risks While insurance is an important risk management tool for companies with complex supply chains, insurers want and need to understand better supply chain risk and are encouraging companies to provide improved information about their critical suppliers and risk management approaches\nBeyond property and casualty lines, Allianz Global Assistance leverages its ability to proactively alert travel insurance policyholders as soon as weather-related loss events become foreseeable - as was done for five tropical storms, two hurricanes and one nor'easter affecting the US in 2012 In conjunction with Allianz P&C lines, these actions are critical to helping customers understand and reduce risks to life safety, property and business as the impacts of climate change on extreme weather become clearer"}]}}

Marine Group\") are part of Tokio Marine Holdings Inc's (\"TMH\") worldwide initiative to become carbon neutral Carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, have been assessed since 2009 The Tokio Marine Group world wide achieved \"carbon neutral\" status in its domestic and overseas business operations in 2013 and again in 2014\nThe Tokio Marine Group has adopted the following practices to assess and reduce or mitigate emissions in the organizations: * Going paperless and/or reducing paper consumption Many offices have switched to printer paper made from recycled content for use when printing is necessary * Purchasing office supplies that are made from green or recycled materials * Transitioning from water bottle coolers to more energy efficient, bottle-less water cooler systems and utilizing reusable bottles in place of plastic water bottles or styrofoam cups * Replacing personal printers with shared, more energy-efficient multi-functional devices * Redesigning workstations to reduce energy costs * Establishing recycling programs for paper, plastic, light bulbs, toner and ink cartridges and cans and bottles at offices nationwide * Encouraging carpooling, vanpooling and other ride share options as well as the use of public transportation * Encouraging bike to work programs * Replacing face-to-face meetings by using video conference equipment, WebEx and other technologies * Participation in TMH's 100 year commitment to the re-forestation of the mangrove trees by having employees take part in planting mangrove trees on plantations in Southeast Asia * Becoming LEED certified in some locations\n* Utilizing timers on lights to reduce energy consumption\nThe Tokio Marine Group has also taken steps to increase environmental education and awareness among its employees Community outreach events are regularly organized to demonstrate the Tokio Marine Group's commitment to reducing environmental impact Initiatives included: * Lunch-and-Learn Events: Representatives from local environmental non-profits invited to speak to employees about areas of environmental concern such as storm water management, clean air and pollution and energy conservation * Employee Volunteer Events: A number of company-sponsored environmental volunteer events have been conducted Since 2012, the Tokio Marine Group has had an environmental corporate social responsibility coordinator on staff * Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (PIIC) established \"GreenPHLY\", a team effort by employees to preserve the environment and mitigate the carbon footprint In 2013, PIIC developed the \"GreenPHLY Environmental Priority Action Plan\" which established the Tokio Marine Group's environmental goals and objectives for the future The plan is focused on three (3) environmental priority areas including carbon footprint reduction, environmental education and awareness and community outreach In support of carbon footprint reduction, carbon emissions as measured by energy usage and paper consumption are tracked using the Hara environment management system software In 2014, the Tokio Marine Group purchased green power equivalent to 100% of the company's electricity use in its offices nationwide In 2014, Tokio Marine America Insurance Company (TMAIC) purchased renewable energy certificates from Terrapass, a social enterprise that provides carbon offsetting products to individuals and businesses TMAIC is currently utilizing more than 1 million kWh of green power This is the equivalent to avoiding the carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity use of more than 100 average homes annually This purchase of green power enabled TMAIC to join the EPA's Green Power Partnership (GPP) and Leadership Club The GPP is a voluntary program that encourages organizations to use green power as a way to reduce the environmental impacts associated with electricity use The GPP assists organizations in procuring electricity generated from renewable sources and recognizes Partners' green power leadership\nKnowing that the data centers consume a substantial amount of energy, more than any other area of the business, the Tokio Marine Group has focused on decreasing energy consumption in that area The Tokio Marine Group partnered with vendors TierPoint and ATT&T to create savings for power and cooling The New York data center was relocated to Piscataway, New Jersey Data Centers are now 95+% virtualized, reducing the overall physical storage footprint and related networking requirements - resulting in superior energy efficiency Older servers are being upgraded to newer, more energy efficient servers while increasing overall capacity A refresh of all desktops and laptops to Windows 7/Office 2010 was completed in 2014 resulting in the elimination of older, less energy efficient and less productive computers In 2014, the latest EMC Storage SAN was purchased which provides superior power and cooling benefits over previous models Also new Cisco network switches purchased are stackable with shared power feeds to reduce power consumption of non-active switches which helps reduce the total power draw"}]}}

Flood\n? Hail\n? Hurricane\n? Tornado\n? Wildfire\n? Winter Weather\n* In addition, our Risk Control division conducts workshops and webinars designed to provide useful information to assist customers with loss mitigation strategies and techniques including those related to severe weather and natural hazards\nClaim Services\nThe Travelers claim department plays an important role in helping customers reduce losses caused by climate influenced events For example, within the \"Prepare and Prevent\" section of Travelerscom, we provide both pre- and post-event mitigation tips for customers such as risk mitigation measures to secure their personal safety and mitigate property damage In addition, as a general matter when possible, Travelers communicates with agents and customers before many major climate-influenced events to inform them of steps they can take to help avoid preventable damage Travelers also communicates after major climate-influenced events to inform agents and customers of steps to mitigate damages, as well as claim reporting and disaster recovery\nEducation and Outreach\nAs part of an ongoing effort to enhance public awareness and knowledge about the need for effective adaptation strategies to reduce losses related to climate influenced events, Travelers supports and participates in research, advocacy, and education through relationships with organizations such as the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety, the Wharton School of Business Risk Management and Decision Processes Center and Habitat for Humanity International Through these independent and joint initiatives, we advance discussions relating to issues such as improved and enforced building codes, prudent land use, disaster preparedness and risk mitigation related to severe weather events and natural disasters"}]}}

USAA has reduced electrical consumption by almost 18% across our owned and operated facilities since 2008 by improving the efficiency of escalators, lighting, and heating and cooling systems, and automating \"sleep modes\" for PCs and monitors\n? In 2016, to supplement its electricity resources, USAA purchased or self-generated more than 23% of the San Antonio and Phoenix campuses' electrical power from renewable energy This amount is roughly equal to the energy needed to power more than 2,300 average-sized San Antonio homes\n? In 2015, nearly one-fourth of USAA's electricity usage came from purchased or generated renewable energy sources, including wind power This includes a 1 MW solar array that we built at our Phoenix campus\n? The San Antonio, Phoenix, Tampa, and Colorado Springs office facilities have all earned the prestigious ENERGY STAR rating from the EPA for more than 10 years\n? Our San Antonio, Phoenix, Tampa, and Colorado Springs office facilities, as well as our West Point Financial Center have all received certificates for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) The LEED Green Building Rating System\u2122\ufe0f is the internationally recognized green building certification system for the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings Two of our buildings have received Platinum certification and were the first office buildings in Arizona and Florida to be recognized with this level of certification\nRecycling - Our recycling program helps conserve energy and raw materials, reduces manufacturing pollution and also reduces the burden on landfills Examples of the program include:\n? Recycling on average more than 65% of waste annually since 2008 In addition, USAA has reduced our overall landfill waste by an average of 25% annually\n? Recycling paper and cardboard that has saved more than 149,000 trees and more than 24,000 cubic yards of landfill space since 2008\n? Recycling more than 300 tons of obsolete electronic equipment and 11,000 tons of paper, wooden pallets and landscape material since 2008\n? Composting on average 60 tons of food waste annually from our cafeterias since 2008\n? Our use of electronic documentation has greatly reduced the use of paper Since 2008, USAA has delivered more than 8 billion pages electronically to our members, an equivalent of more than 800,000 trees\n? USAA has also reduced office print volume by more than 40% since 2008\nAir Quality - We work to limit our air quality impact in everything from the chemicals used in our facilities to employee commuting and fleet vehicle emissions Examples include:\n? Increasing fleet miles per gallon by more than 15% since 2008 by switching to electric and more fuel efficient, low-emission fleet vehicles\n? More than 3,200 USAA employees' voluntary participate in alternative commuting programs USAA also encourages carpooling, bike-riding, mass transit, and other alternatives, as well as providing a flexible work-at-home program, that have avoided more than 56 million commuter miles and prevented nearly 28,000 tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere\n? Avoiding use of grounds maintenance equipment and vehicles on Air Quality Health Alert days\n? Using \"green cleaning\" products to protect health without harming the environment\nWater - USAA recognizes the role we play in conserving precious water resources Examples include:\n? Reducing fresh-water consumption by more than 50 million gallons since 2008\n? Replacing high-flow toilets and shower heads with low-flow fixtures and installing sink aerators to reduce fresh water use by more than six million gallons annually\n?

cross-functional Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) Working Group to assess Protective's ESG impact with a focus on strategy, governance, and communications In 2021, the group evolved into the Sustainability Task Force, including representatives from Accounting, Risk, Legal, Compliance, Investments, Corporate Responsibility, Communications, Human Resources, Government Affairs, Facilities, Business Lines, and the Protective Life Foundation The Sustainability Task Force is led by Protective's Executive Vice President, Corporate Responsibility, Strategy, and Innovation and meets monthly It is responsible for developing the roadmap of actions and initiatives for sustainability at Protective, and it continuously monitors and responds to the external, regulatory, and competitive environments It also provides quarterly report outs to Protective's Strategic Priorities Committee, which includes the top 18 executives in the company Additionally, it reports out as needed to the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors, most recently the Audit Committee in August 2021 Currently, the Sustainability Task Force is developing Protective's first annual Sustainability Report to launch in October 2021 and working with PwC to develop a 3-year sustainability roadmap to be completed by the end of 2021\nIn addition, Protective works closely with its parent company, Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc (Dai-ichi), on climate risk In 2021, Dai-ichi launched a Greenhouse Gas Reduction project and identified a Sustainability Champion within each of its group companies Dai-ichi established a goal of reducing its carbon footprint by 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2040 Dai-ichi set forth a goal for each group company to set individualized targets to help achieve the 2040 target Currently, Protective is working to establish intermediate and long-term targets\nIn August 2021, Protective announced an agreement with Alabama Power for the purchase of \"Renewable Energy Certificates\" (REC) for the Birmingham, Alabama corporate headquarters office utility usage This agreement provides for a 100% offset of corporate office power usage via renewable energy from a sustainable energy provider The RECs retired for Protective's headquarters were sourced through Alabama Power from the Chisholm View Wind Farm in Oklahoma\nIn 2020, Protective expanded its virtual workforce to reinforce its commitment to a sustainable and best-in-class culture Over the past 18 months, Protective has retired its physical offices in Illinois, Tennessee, Colorado, Florida, and New Hampshire, significantly reducing its carbon footprint in these states Employees who regularly worked in those offices are now part of Protective's robust virtual workforce Going forward, Protective will have three core sites with physical office locations in Birmingham, Alabama, the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region, and St Louis, Missouri\nProtective's Birmingham, Alabama corporate office, where approximately 40% of its employees are physically located, is equipped with various features to help reduce emissions Since 2014, Protective has reduced the corporate office building's energy consumption by 15% The building lighting system runs on a timer and is equipped with motion sensors, each of which are calibrated so most of the lights in the building are either dimmed or powered off outside normal business hours All fluorescent lights are being replaced with LED lights--lights with a longer life span and are 30% more efficient than fluorescent lights The building's heating and cooling systems are run on a similarly calibrated timer outside of normal business hours Additionally, the data center utilizes third party monitoring software designed to maximize operational efficiency and minimize energy usage through use of a water-cooling system\nTo help emphasize emission reduction in all three core sites and across the virtual workforce, employees are encouraged to minimize travel where possible To enable virtual meetings, Protective has equipped numerous conference rooms at its core sites with computer hardware and software that increases teleconferencing functionality Since the pandemic began in March 2020, travel has decreased significantly, and as Protective moves forward past the pandemic, there are plans to continue to encourage use of alternative means of meeting versus traveling where appropriate\nProtective has a corporate-wide recycling program to encourage both the virtual workforce and office-based employees to recycle plastic, paper, and aluminum Protective's three core sites participate in recycling programs within each office Annually, the Birmingham, Alabama corporate office recycles approximately 24 tons of material 100% of this material is diverted from the landfill and sent to a local recycling company\nWhen Protective conducts building renovations, all metal and carpet removed during the renovation is recycled Any new carpet installed is certified carbon neutral across its full product life cycle In newly renovated spaces, automated window shades minimize the heat load on the space When possible, demountable wall systems are used in lieu of traditional drywall construction to allow for modification and reuse\nProtective encourages its customers to utilize online bill payment options, voice signature, and to go paperless by using its eDelivery program to securely access and download documents online In 2020, Protective saw significant increases in customer digital adoption during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic Electronic application volume increased 27%, voice signature volume increased 65%, and electronic policy delivery volume increased 122% Since January 2021, electronic application volume has increased 51%, voice signature volume has increased 62%, and electronic policy delivery volume has increased 13%"}]}}

risks closely and generally seeks to manage its exposure to them through individual risk selection, monitoring risk accumulation, purchase of reinsurance and use of available data in estimating potential catastrophic risks The occurrence of natural or manmade disasters can adversely affect AXA's financial condition, profitability, and cash flows, especially as catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable\nAs AXA can have no assurance that it will be able to adequately anticipate climate and risks evolutions, its Investments and Risk Management teams have prioritized the risks by evaluating the financial impact of floods and windstorms on the buildings and infrastructure on AXA's physical assets portfolio\nThis is done through the \"NatCat\" models, which combine stochastic events in Europe and the US and a geo-localized portfolio of real assets It results in specific \"destruction rates\", which factor location, infrastructure type and construction materials, and are then used to determine potential damage rates and derive a potential loss for each physical asset This analysis shows that both annual average losses, as well as losses generated by flood and windstorm events with a return period of 100 years, remain limited compared to the total asset value\nIn addition to this financial indicator, AXA also measures the \"warming potential\" of its corporate bonds and equity and sovereign debt assets This potential is derived from the carbon intensity alignment of each company with sectoral 2degC targets\nDescription of AXA's process for managing climate-related risks and opportunities for its investments\nConverting international climate objectives (eg COP21 Paris Agreement) into quantitative investment targets is a new and complex risk modelling exercise which AXA tested in 2016 using a methodology developed by the \"2deg Investing Initiative\" think tank Building on the results of the methodology, AXA pursued in 2017 a \"test and learn\" approach by reviewing another external methodology developed by Carbon Delta This one analyses and prioritizes risks and opportunities based on information related to: transition risks at company and sector-level that result from regulatory efforts to limit global temperature change to below 2 degrees, and physical risks resulting from the impacts of extreme weather events on real assets\nClimate change is a component in the Environment pillar of the overall ESG framework to track AXA's investments performance This framework leverages AXA Investment Managers' \"RI Search\" tool and MSCI data for AllianceBernstein, containing cross-asset ESG scores and impact-type metrics for about 81% of AXA's General Account assets AXA is working on implementing a requirement where portfolio managers will have to select assets such that the total ESG score of their portfolio for the current year is not lower than the previous year, thus helping managers to better integrate climate issues into their portfolio management\nExample of how AXA's risk management process is applied to:\na) Physical risks and opportunities\nOpportunities in new markets: AXA's analysis of climate transition opportunities helped it identify a climate related opportunity in green infrastructure Indeed, AXA and the International Finance Corporation announced the launch of a $500m partnership supporting an infrastructure fund that will notably finance green infrastructures in emerging countries, including renewable energy, water, green transport and telecom\nb) Transitional risks and opportunities\nAXA decided to move away from the most carbon-intensive industries by expanding divestment and restricting insurance and underwriting AXA was the first global investor to initiate divestment from coal Concretely, AXA decided to increase five-folds its divestment from the coal industry, to reach EUR3bn, by expanding its coal exclusion criteria AXA also decided to end its investments from the main oil sands producers and the main associated pipelines players On the insurance side, AXA no longer underwrites risks related to oil sands production and oil sands transportation via pipelines Additionally, AXA has stopped underwriting upstream oil & gas exploration business in arctic regions\nThe growing awareness on climate change issues pushed AXA to identify the areas where demand for specific Green Products could increase Proving its belief in this area of business, AXA committed in 2015 to reach EUR3bn in green investments by 2020, and further committed to set the bar higher to reach EUR12bn by 2020 This investment in green products includes notably green infrastructures, green bonds, property, and commercial real estate with stringent environmental standards"}]}}
