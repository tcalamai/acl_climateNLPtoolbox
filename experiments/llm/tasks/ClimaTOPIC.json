This is in addition to raising the minimum energy efficiency standard for all projects. As written in Appendix Z, the design of a NZE building shall be achieved through three complementary approaches including: reducing building energy demand for heating and cooling through the use of passive design and improved envelope performance techniques; reducing total building energy demand through the installation of high efficiency mechanical, lighting and power systems; and supplying remaining building energy needs from a renewable source of energy. Additional minimum performance requirements for building thermal energy performance and airtightness have been set to ensure new construction achieves a high degree of energy conservation prior to pursuing renewable energy generation. Restrictions are placed on the procurement of off-site renewable energy generation to ensure new, regional generation capacity is being created. The District aims to incentivize early adopters to test Appendix Z and provide feedback ahead of a planned 2026 mandate for all construction to achieve NZE. The updates in the 2017 Energy Conservation Code apply to both new construction and various levels of rehabilitation, raising the bar for efficiency in existing buildings undergoing renovation as well.In parallel to the code work, the District is working to catalyze net-zero energy buildings by creating a program to offer early design assistance for projects committed to pursuing NZE, offering 7 grants of up to $20,000 each in 2019 & 2020."}]}}

To reduce the worst impacts of climate change, the City of Toronto has a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050, or sooner. To reach the target, all existing homes and buildings in Toronto will need to be much more energy efficient than they are today. To date, the BBP has facilitated more than 2,600 projects, resulting in over 4.6 million MWh in energy savings and eliminating the equivalent of 810,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.The programs developed through this initiative include:Home Energy Loan Program Expansion To date, the Home Energy Loan Program has received over 1000 applications and completed over 220 projects. The average value of a HELP projects is $21,000, with participants realizing energy savings of $560 per year. In 2019, homes that used HELP reduced their total average annual GHG emissions from 10.9 tonnes to 6.9 tonnes. In 2020 staff are seeking to amend the program to better support equity-seeking and vulnerable populations and provide more affordable options to homeowners. Staff are participating in a Federation of Canadian Municipalities funding opportunity to support energy loans and new prescriptive programs that will encourage residential energy retrofit in Toronto.Please see link for more details: <URL> <URL> Retrofit Loan Program and The Hi-RISThe Energy Retrofit Loan program and the Hi-RIS (this is an LIC program that is very similar to HELP, but for apartment buildings) retrofit improvement support program. Through its Energy Retrofit Loan program, the City offers low-interest loans to help building owners improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. All buildings located in Toronto are eligible. The City offers financing for up to 100% of project costs, at a rate equal to the City's cost of borrowing, with repayment terms up to 20 years.Please see link for more details: <URL> Will InitiativeThe Green Will Initiative, championed by Mayor John Tory seeks to accelerate greenhouse gas emissions reductions by improving the energy efficiency of public and private-owned buildings across Toronto. A program of the City's Better Buildings Partnership, the Green Will Initiative will see the City and property owners work together to make major strides towards addressing the climate emergency and achieve Toronto's net-zero emissions target.Navigation Support Services <URL> Buildings Navigation & Support Services provides building owners, operators, and property managers support navigating the process of improving the energy efficiency of their buildings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These improvements help decrease operating costs, increase occupant comfort, and improve the overall value of buildings.Better Buildings Navigation & Support Services can help you to:*Identify potential energy efficiency opportunities in your building*Access available incentives and financing for identified projects*Overcome hurdles you may be facing with project implementation*Work with you one-on-one, offering tailored support every step of the wayEnergy & Water Reporting and Benchmarking (EWRB)The Province of Ontario's Energy & Water Reporting and Benchmarking (EWRB) regulation Opens in new window, is designed to help building owners and managers improve their building's energy and water efficiency. Through this regulation, some privately owned buildings (greater than 50,000 square feet) will be required to report annual energy and water consumption and performance data.Full details on the regulation can be found on Ontario's EWRB Guide (<URL>). The third mandatory reporting deadline has been extended to October 1, 2020 from July 1, 2020. Step by Step instructions on reporting can be found below:<URL>"}]}}

As mentionens above, the city of Copenhagen are on the way to decarbonising the electricity and heat supply in the city by working with the decarbonising the publicly owned utilities. It is nevertheless important for the City of Copenhagen to reduce the energy consumption within the building stock, since it benefits the transition toward carbon neutrality on socio- and private economic scale. Therefore, Copenhagen have several different initiatives that target energy reduction in the private building stock.One of the most progressive actions are Energy Leap, which is a network for the largest building owners in Copenhagen, targeting 3 % annual reductions in all the buildings. Currently the members of this network account for 20 % of the total building stock in Copenhagen. In 2019 the city furthermore initiated a cooperation with social housing associations with the aim of testing and implementing systems for intelligent energy management and education of staff. Social housing accounts for up to 20% of the buldings stock within the housing in Copenhagen.Copenhagen have succeeded in reducing the city's total electricity consumption by 8 % in comparison to 2010, while the heat consumption is still at the 2010-level. But in the same period the city has grown with more building and citizens, and this have equalized a lot of the energy savings. The City of Copenhagen is rather progressive and advanced regarding reducing the energy consumption within municipal buildings, with an estimated reduction on 20 % compared to 2010. This is an area where we have full control of managing the buildings, systems and economy. A comprehensive energy surveillance system has been installed in almost all municipal buildings to measure and inform improvement to energy efficiency in the buildings. This allows the municipality to monitor the electricity, heat and water consumption on an hour-by-hour basis through a digital system. The system also estimates what the energy consumption should be based on different parameters e.g. weather, and thereby it is possible to compare that to the actual consumption. There is an established task force in the department of building properties, that works on how the municipality can save energy from its buildings using the data from the surveillance system reducing the energy consumption."}]}}

In this perspective, it will launch a long-term renovation programme for its most energy-inefficient buildings including 300 primary schools, 40 secondary schools and 15 swimming pools. In 2020, the City of Paris will draft a Master Plan for the Energy Efficiencyof Public Buildings (Schema Directeur de Performance Energetique des Batiments Publics) in order to optimise the management of its property assets. For the residential sector, the City of Paris will continue to support social housing providers in their efforts to renovate their stock on a massive scale. The target is to reduce energy consumption by 35% in all social housing stock by 2030 and 50% by 2050 in relation to 2004, taking account of all improvements made. To achieve these targets, the number of renovations is increased to 5,000 housing units per year from 2020, which will require in particular that the investment capacities of lessors be guaranteed by the State.Furthermore, the energy-efficiency projects of residents of jointly owned properties in Paris currently receive support from the City and the Paris Climate Agency, in particular via the \"Eco-renovons Paris\" scheme which contributes to reducing energy consumption and combating fuel poverty. This programme and those carried out by the APC will need to be stepped up and adapted in order to boost the rate of energy renovations. For the tertiary sector, the major specialized operators and large corporations must continue to renovate their assets and will be able to benefit from the impetus provided by the Paris Climate Action Charter. In addition, the City of Paris will establish a specific support programme for renovations carried about by small-scale tertiary/service sector operators (e.g. shops, self-employed professionals, etc.) after 2020."}]}}

The law states that by January 1, 2021, DGS shall develop a strategic energy management plan for reducing energy and water use across the DGS portfolio of buildings. The plan shall include timelines and cost estimates for implementing:(1) An energy retrofit program across at least 9% of the DGS portfolio of District government-owned buildings by square footage between 2021 and 2024, prioritizing buildings that have core systems and equipment nearing the end of their useful lives, with a goal of achieving at least 30% reductions in energy and greenhouse gas emissions; and(2) A net-zero energy retrofit program across at least 12.5% of the DGS portfolio of District government-owned buildings between 2026 and 2032.To date, DGS has also deployed its retro-commissioning/retrofit program at roughly 100 buildings with building automation systems, sensors, controls, and communication network upgrades. Through retro-commissioning, DGS identifies and prioritizes capital upgrades to augment existing mechanical and control systems. In this process, installed and customized data collection monitors capture building performance data that includes space temperature, asset-level information such as boiler, chiller, and air handler cycling; and how often outdoor air is brought into the facility. Consequently, frequent performance monitoring of the building systems can be used to support long-term planning for capital retrofits enhancing building performance and comfort.During the retro-commissioning process, DGS applies industry best practices, tuning the building and evaluating the building equipment and control performance. The performance data gathered helps inform DGS in targeting investments towards improving energy performance, and carefully direct data-driven follow-on capital upgrades, thereby enabling DGS to lower both the immediate and total lifetime cost of building operations.Additionally, the District's building energy performance standard (see Mitigation Efforts) sets a minimum threshold of energy performance that will be no lower than the local median ENERGY STAR score by property type (or equivalent metric). Buildings that do not meet the standard will be required to improve their energy performance 20% over a 5-year period. This means that 50% of DC's building stock over 50,000 sq. ft. will be make improvements or retrofitting their buildings in the next five years. To support buildings complying with this new standard, the District is helping to launch a high-performance building hub to help District building industry professionals take actions to improve building performance across new and existing buildings to meet the District's climate and green building goals. The hub has completed a needs assessment of the specific training, capacity buildings, support, and technical assistance needs of the District's building owners and the consultants they rely on; such as architects, contractors, facility managers, property managers, and real estate brokers. The Hub will also serve as a trusted translator between building industry professionals and related District entities and support systems including the District of Columbia Sustainable Energy Utility, the DC Green Bank, the District Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, and other related branches within DOEE. The hub will launch as a digital platform in Fall 2020."}]}}

The BEPS is a minimum threshold of energy performance that will be no lower than the local median ENERGY STAR score by property type (or equivalent metric). The standards were created to drive energy performance in existing buildings to help meet the energy and climate goals of the Sustainable DC plan -- to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by 50% by 2032.DOEE will establish the first set of standards by January 1, 2021. Standards will then be set every 6 years, creating BEPS periods (BEPS 1, BEPS 2, etc.). These requirements build upon the success of the District's Energy Benchmarking program, so buildings mandated to benchmark are also subject to the BEPS program. As the benchmarking requirements ratchet down in square footage over time, buildings will be subject to the BEPS requirements in following periods until all buildings 10,000 sq. ft. and over are following the performance standards. Buildings that do not meet the standard for a BEPS period will be placed in a 5-year compliance cycle. The building owner has until the end of the cycle to bring their building into compliance following one of the compliance paths available. More details about the paths will be available once the rules and guidance documents are finalized by DOEE. For more information, please see: <URL>"}]}}

Consequently, the City of Paris will be asking real-estate operators to ensure that the new building supply is designed with reversibility and versatility in mind. The aim is to enable a building to accommodate several functions (family dwellings, hostels, offices and workshops, etc.), which can change over time without the need for renovations, major upgrading or demolition and rebuilding- operations synonymous with high levels of greenhouse gas emissions."}]}}

Additionally our NO2 and Ozone concentrations are measured in ppb, rather than the units listed in the AQI chart below. Finally, while we had no days that fell into the worst bands (AQI values 201 - 400) the fields will not let us enter values greater than 1,000 which does not allow us to reflect our NO2 concentrations. For example, our moderate category is an AQI value of 51-100; the 24hr PM 2.5 concentration is between 12.1 - 35.4 but the table does not allow us to input all that data. The NO2 concentrations for the worst AQI band range from 1250 - 1649 and that data is not allowed in the field either. We are happy to send a follow up sheet with the index information and our exceedances if that is helpful."}]}}

Passenger cars are not affected by the low emission regulations. Vans:Diesel-powered vans weighing up to 3.5 tonnes are not allowed to drive in the low emission zone unless they have been fitted with a particulate filter. The regulations apply to all diesel vans irrespective of the colour of the number plate. The regulations for driving a van in the low emission zone are divided into three phases:Phase 1: from 1 July 2020Vans must be registered on or later than the 1st of January 2007 to drive within the low emission zone. Phase 2: from 2 July 2022Vans must be registered on or later than the 1st of January 2012 to drive within the low emission zone. Phase 3: from 1 July 2025Vans must be registered on or later than the 1st of September 2016 to drive within the low emission zone. Trucks and busesHeavy diesel-powered vehicles (trucks and buses) weighing more than 3.5 tonnes must be fitted with a particulate filter to enter the low emission zone. The regulations for driving diesel-powered heavy vehicles (buses and trucks) in the low emission zone are divided into two phases:Phase 1, from 1 July 2020:Buses and trucks must be registered on or later than the 1st of October 2009 to drive within the low emission zone. Euro 5 or EEV heavy-duty vehicles are exempt from the date rule and can enter the low emission zone until the 1st of January 2022 without being retrofitted with a particle filter. Phase 2, from 1 January 2022:Buses and trucks must be registered on or later than the 1st of January 2015 to drive within the low emission zone. The regulations in the low emission zone do not apply to:- Vehicles registered in Denmark for veteran driving- Vehicles registered abroad that are more than 30 years old- Vehicles used by the armed forces, the police or other emergency services when there is an exceptional need to use the vehicle in the low emission zone. It is, however, a condition that the vehicle does not usually drive in the low emission zone.- Vehicles used by the armed forces, the police or other emergency services when such vehicles are used in connection with emergency preparedness exercises within the low emission zone."}]}}

The French capital has been preparing since 2015 to implement this government scheme which aims to limit access to central Paris by highly polluting vehicles by means of Crit'Air stickers which indicate the level of pollution emitted by vehicles. The categories of vehicles authorised to travel will change in several stages (2017, 2019, 2021-2022), to ensure the progressive implementation of the scheme until the Zero Diesel in Paris target is attained in 2024. In an approach based on territorial partnerships with areas outside the Paris city limits, the City of Paris has decided with The Grand Paris metropolitan authority (la Metropole du Grand Paris) to extend the ZCR to the metropolitan area in compliance with the Breathable Cities (Villes Respirables) strategy16. To ensure the effectiveness of this Low Emissions Zone, an automated monitoring and penalty scheme will be considered in partnership with Police Headquarters. At the same time, the City will be further strengthening the ZCR scheme within its territory between now and 2030 with the aim of attaining the target of zero petrol-powered vehicles in Paris by 2030.Since the 1st of July he categories of vehicles authorised is now Crit'Air stickers 1,2 and 3"}]}}

In general, the infrastructure of Elsinore is well connected throughout the town. Both cycling paths and public transport connects almost every corner of Elsinore. Despite the well-connected infrastructure, data shows that 55% of all travels are made by car, and 53% of our citizens commute more than 10 km.With The Mobility Plan 2015 - 2020, Elsinore has a strategical approach in using the potential of the well-combined infrastructure to get more citizens to use a greener alternative than the car.Better and more bicycle parking at the Elsinore station and more parking lots at Espergaerde Station makes multimodality more appealing. To make the greener transport systems more attractive, Elsinore collaborates in different programs within the Capital Region, such as the so-called \"super cycle highway\" program.Yearly a transport behaviour questionnaire is conducted to estimate the transport mode share"}]}}

Bag fee revenue is deposited into the Anacostia River Clean Up and Protection Fund, a special-purpose fund managed by DOEE. The sole purpose of the fund is to support watershed protection initiatives, including education programs, stream restoration efforts, trash capture projects, and community outreach including the distribution of reusable bags. Other materials regulations include the more recent foam and straw bans. The Sustainable DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2014 bans the use of disposable food service ware made of expanded polystyrene and other products that cannot be recycled or composted. Enforcement of the foam ban started January 1, 2016 and enforcement for single-use plastic straws and stirrers began January 1, 2019."}]}}

By 2020, all school administrations must have signed this Charter that formalises the managers' commitment to implement concrete action (recipes using leftovers, donation of remaining meals to associations, etc.). This will be followed by the widespread implementation of anti-waste measures in all types of local government institutional catering. To combine the fight against food waste with the provision of food aid, all food markets held in Paris must implement a recovery-transformation donation scheme between now and 2030. This solution will consist of collecting unsold items that are still consumable from vendors and redistributing them through specialised local associations."}]}}

Already decided mandatory food waste separation from 2021 for restaurants and other businesses and from citizens from 2023. Mandatory sorting of packaging materials to producers collections systems since decades.Waste segregation is, and has been, our main objective together with reduction for several years. One of the primary goals in the city's Waste Management Plan is to reduce the amounts of waste produced and to treat the waste that is produced as resource efficient as possible.The city has for decades continuously steered new waste fractions away towards materials recycling where there has been recycling possibilities available for those materials. Sometimes even pushing the market in the direction of creating such possibilities though tenders and R&D projects. For instance, bulky waste from households is collected from the citizens in around 30 different categories, before being further sorted by personnel in a similar amount of sub-categories for reuse and materials recycling. Leaving \"mixed waste\" at bulky waste collection centres is, since years, no longer an option in Stockholm.Reuse focus has been applied to all bulky waste collection centres in the city and new co-operations with NGO:s and other actors to increase rates for reuse and recycling of new materials categories are started and improved upon regularly.New services promoting reuse and recycling are launched regularly, recently for instance a mobile Pop Up Reuse Centre moving around public spaces on a schedule."}]}}

The remainder (16%) is deposited in containers and delivered by the Council or a contractor for processing. Regardless of collection method, all vehicles entering waste treatment facilities are weighed-in over a weighbridge regulated by Trading Standards. The weights of individual vehicles are provided to the council and the sum of these weights is used to calculate the total amount of municipal waste managed by the City Council in a year.Weights from specific treatment facilities (recycling, composting, energy from waste and landfill) are used to apportion the % of total municipal waste recycled, recovered or landfilled by standard maths where the denominator is total MSW and the numerator is the amount apportioned to a specific waste treatment.All weighbridge data is saved on Excel spreadsheets which are retained in Council network and Teams shared drives access, with access restricted to specific waste management, finance and audit staff. All data is checked and collated through a rigorous process of validation prior to its use for invoice payments and performance measurement.Neither Newcastle City Council nor any other organisation, whether governmental or private, retains or collates records of waste collected and treated by non-City Council systems. The weights of non-Council collected waste in Newcastle is therefore unknown and can only ever be estimated with attendant concerns on accuracy."}]}}

With this technology, it is possible to guarantee a quick unloading of the compactors directly on the trailers or in the pit, avoiding delay in unloading.The shed of the overflow station is closed, with 4,000 m2 of built area, having a system of activated carbon filters, which works by absorbing the indoor air which, after being filtered, is returned to nature. 180,000 m3 of air are processed per hour and the station has the capacity to transfer up to 2.5 thousand tons / day of waste / day.Metropolitan Landfill Center- It occupies an area of 250ha. Operated since 1999 by the BATTRE concession company for a period of 20 years (Competition No. 004/99). Licensed by the Environmental Resource Center (CRA) to exclusively receive household waste, Class IIA (NBR 10004/04). Shared with the municipalities of Lauro de Freitas and Simoes Filho (Cooperation Agreement 30/98). Daily, about 2,800 tons of waste arrive in uninterrupted journeys in the 12 trucks that transport the Transhipment Station in Canabrava, the first stop for the garbage collected, to the landfill, at km 6 of Estrada do Cia-Aeroporto.The \"leachate\", liquid from the decomposition of organic matter, dark in color and unpleasant odor, with a high pollution capacity, is collected and transported by a water tank vehicle to be treated for ETE at the Environmental Protection Company (CETREL ), ,n Camacari, where it is treated together with the effluents from the Camacari Pole, and then discarded by the submarine outfall.The plant uses what is left of the waste as fuel for the first biogas thermoelectric station in the Northeast. About 65% of the waste produced by the city that arrives at the collection and cleaning units is sent to the transhipment station, located in Canabrava. When this material arrives at the landfill, at the CIA, it goes through the process so that biogas can later be generated. The flow is continuous and as the production of waste goes through the process, the extraction of biogas occurs for the generation of energy.The biogas used for energy production is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide produced during the decomposition of organic waste inside the landfill. The gases are removed by pipes connected to a drainage system responsible for taking the biogas to Termoverde. Before, still in the landfill, it undergoes a kind of pre-treatment in which the moisture and particles still suspended are removed.To make energy generation a reality, Salvador has a thermoelectric plant powered by biogas located in the sanitary landfill, Termoverde Salvador. An average of 10,000 MWh / month is generated, enough energy to supply the demand of around 200 thousand inhabitants .Since 2005, the landfill has already mitigated 8 million tons of CO2 equivalent.It has a certificate for reduced emission (CERs) of carbon - Kyoto Protocol. The capital is the first city in the world to obtain a United Nations (UN) registration for the emission of carbon credits with engineering in landfillsLinks: <URL>"}]}}

It applies to all events held on municipal ground, i.e. the city's parks, squares, halls and other public spaces owned by the city. It also applies to all kinds of events such as concerts, sports competitions, flea markets and street parties. City of Copenhagen are hosting the upcoming mega events EURO2021, World Pride 2021 and Tour de France Grand Depart in 2022 and here the beverages will be served in reusable cups.Additionally, the City of Copenhagen is promoting the transition to reusable packaging by establishing test zones in the city where restaurants, cafes and food stalls will encourage customers to use reusable packaging for take-away. The test zones will be established in the fall of 2021 and the lessons from the tests will be gathered and made available to all stakeholders. <URL>"}]}}

These actions will result in an estimated 10 million metric tons of CO2e reductions by 2030. Examples include: Building energy performance mandates, advanced building codes, 100% renewable electricity in City operations, electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, sustainable transportation and organics separation. - With the measurable near-term actions alone, NYC will not achieve the GHG reductions necessary to be on an accelerated 80 x 50 trajectory that aligns with a 1.5 degree outcome. The remaining 15 near-term actions will enable, accelerate, or multiply GHG reductions to push NYC closer to the accelerated trajectory. Examples include: carbon pricing, enhanced climate change communications, workforce able to deliver climate objectives, PACE financing program, improved vehicle and efficiency standards and competitively priced materials and technologies. - Reaching g the City's long-term climate objectives will require persistent effort and constant reevaluation of progress and strategies.- The development of a global cities protocol for carbon neutrality will inform how NYC can reach carbon neutrality through offsetting remaining emissions after all technically feasible in-city emission reductions are achieved.(This plan drew on the extensive analysis and stakeholder engagement conducted to produce the Roadmap to 80 x 50. For more on the 80 x 50 plan, see nyc.gov/80x50.)"}]}}

To identify thetotal need for reduction, the 2020 target of 2.3 tonnes of CO2eemissions per resident must be adjusted to reflect not only theanticipated increase in population, but also the construction ofnew homes and other factors.The City's own forecasts indicate that the population ofStockholm will rise to 1 million by 2020. To calculate the totalneed for emissions reductions by this date, current emissionslevels have been adjusted to take account of the rise inpopulation.A direct reduction in emissions is anticipated as a result of thefollowing factors:--Lamps and electrical utensils are becoming more energyefficient,so electricity use is not expected to increase, despitethe rise in population.--Stockholm's population is expected to increase at a fasterrate than the construction of residential and other premises,which will necessitate a more efficient use of living andworking space.--Certain energy-efficiency improvements are expected in theexisting building stock.These factors are expected to lead to a reduction ofapproximately 130,000 tonnes of CO2e.However, to achieve the goal of no more than 2.3 tonnes ofCO2e per resident, it is estimated that the total reduction in CO2eemissions from the 2012 level needs to be slightly more than533,000 tonnes."}]}}

Additionally, actions outlined in the plan reflect local responsibility toward reducing the causes of global climate change and it's negative affects around the world, and to do so in an equitable manner. Actions in the plan were chosen because they were locally relevant and the most impactful choices to achieve a short-term 26-18 percent greenhouse gas reduction goal by 2025 and an 80 percent reduction goal by 2050. The actions will help position Iowa City as a national leader in sustainable practices, which can be used to maintain and drive economic development. Actions are organized into three traditional emissions-producing categories, a category on adapting to climate change, and a section on personal lifestyle changes: Buildings, Transportation, Waste, Adaptation and Sustainable lifestyle. A number of actions are already being implemented and other complementary actions can be undertaken immediately and will have cumulative effects. Some actions will require a longer timeframe to implement. Actions specific to climate action are included in this report, but a separate Vulnerability Assessment and Climate Adaptation report contains more comprehensive details on risk-based adaptation measures.\""}]}}

This shows that at the end of Quarter 1 2019, Newcastle had:- 11,346kW of solar PV installations (of which 7,038kW are domestic) across 2,938 properties (of which 2,193 are domestic)- a single 305kW anaerobic digestion installation (non-domestic) - 3kW micro CHP installations across 3 properties (all of which are domestic properties)These figures inform the data included in section 8.2 below.In addition the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) figures set out in the attached document entitled '8.1 RHI_monthly_official_stats_tables_Dec_19_final.xlsx' show the city level accredited RHI installations and the installed capacity (MW) but do not split this information down by technology. The technology split out is only at national level. Therefore we have used the city figures and taken an average figure based on the weighted average MW of installed capacity according to the national technology split, and stated this figure in section 8.2 below - the calculations are shown in the attached document entitled '8.2 RHI deployment calculations.xlsx'.

On March 22, 2019, the District's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 became law, which enacted the most recent update to the city's Renewable Portfolio Standard, strengthening it to require 100% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, including 5.5% from local solar. The law also sets a longer-term local solar generation target of meeting 10% of electricity usage with local solar by 2041. The RPS standard was put in place in 2005 and updated in 2008, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 amendment, known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act of 2016 also created a funding mechanism for the Solar for All program, which establishes a goal of putting solar on 100,000 low income households in the District. In 2017, more than 13.6% of total electricity use in the District was supplied by renewable energy, however this is a conservative and likely underestimation, as it only captures the compliance market. There is also a voluntary renewable market, which we have not reported here as we suspect there is some overlap between the two, and we erred on the side of not double-counting that generation."}]}}

With the rebuilding, the heat production from HOK will increase, and in relation to the situation today, the rebuilt work will therefore displace natural gas heat, but also gas consumption on boilers. A large part of the CO2 potential is therefore met with this decision, and it is estimated that in 2030 production will only be needed on gas boilers in peak load situations. Second step: However, it is decided through the Plan for Climate and Sustainability 2020-2030 that Elsinore Supply Company needs to present a plan for conversion from biomass to large heat pumps and/ or similar RE alternatives. Thus, the target is only achieved when the conversion from biomass to a RE alternative."}]}}

On March 22, 2019, the District's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 became law, which enacted the most recent update to the city's Renewable Portfolio Standard, strengthening it to require 100% of electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, including 5.5% from local solar. The law also sets a longer-term local solar generation target of meeting 10% of electricity usage with local solar by 2041. The RPS standard was put in place in 2005 and updated in 2008, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 amendment, known as the Renewable Portfolio Standard Expansion Amendment Act of 2016 also created a funding mechanism for the Solar for All program, which establishes a goal of putting solar on 100,000 low income households in the District. In 2019, more 17.5% of total electricity use in the District was supplied by renewable energy, including 1.85 from local solar, however this is a conservative and likely underestimation, as it only captures the compliance market. There is also a voluntary renewable market, which we have not reported here as we suspect there is some overlap between the two, and we erred on the side of not double-counting that generation."}]}}

This policy demonstrates the commitment of the City of Hamilton to: Healthy Eating, including the provision of food that is free of industrially produced trans fats and accommodations for those with special dietary needs; Safe food handling practices; and The Solid Waste Management Master Plan (SWMMP). Almost 60% of Hamilton adults were classified as overweight or obese in 2007/08, which is significantly higher than Ontario adults, overall1. Overweight and obesity can significantly impact the health and well-being of City of Hamilton employees. The provisions and standards in this policy will help employees avoid chronic disease, disability and the associated costs which impact the individual, the employer, and the community. Healthy eating is fundamental to good health. Individuals who eat healthy foods are more likely to lead longer, healthier lives. The benefits of healthy eating include: Overall health and vitality; Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer and osteoporosis; Reduced risk of overweight and obesity and ; Adequate intake of vitamin, minerals and other nutrients. This policy applies to all City employees, including but not limited to regular, temporary and contract employees, and to consultants, volunteers, trainees and students when food and beverages are provided and funded by the City of Hamilton for all staff related and hosted events. This includes but is not limited to the serving of food for business meetings, training, education, appreciation and hosted events. Some management and professional staff are required, as part of their business responsibilities for the City, to participate in hospitality events with external parties where additional food and beverages to those included in this Policy are available. Such participation is not a breach of this Policy, so long as the hospitality event serves a legitimate business purpose. Hamilton City Council endorsed the 10 Year Food Strategy that includes four overarching goals, 14 recommendations and 46 actions focused on the city's food system."}]}}

Data from 2019.The City of Stockholm work hard to both to reduce edible food waste and to collect the remaining non-edible food waste from the city owned kitchens, as well as from restaurants and households in the city. The aim of the city's new Environment Programme 2020-2023 is to collect 70 % of all the non-edible food waste generated in the city in 2023 as well as to reduce the current edible food waste in accordance with the aim of the Agenda 2030 goals 12.3 Halve Food Waste and 12.5 Reduce Waste Generation. About 25 040 tonnes food waste was collected in 2019, which is about 36 % of all the generated food waste in the city.In November 2019 the City Council of Stockholm decided to make it mandatory for all restaurants, caterers, coffee shops in the city, and for the city owned public kitchens, to separate their food waste and have it collected. This will include all food places/ venues in the city that prepare and serve 25 portions of food or more per day. Currently about 50 % of the restaurants and 25 % of the households in Stockholm separate and have their food waste collected by the city owned waste company."}]}}

The Healthy Schools Act of 2010 reimburses schools an additional five cents for meal components that are locally grown and unprocessed and requires District schools to source locally grown, sustainable foods whenever possible. Per the food services contract, 30% of all food ingredients and products served or used at DCPS locations must be purchased locally. DCPS, the Department of Parks & Recreation (DPR), and the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services (DYRS) all give preference to vendors who can source a minimum of 10% of fruits and vegetables locally. DCPS has been studying the Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) -- a metric-based, flexible framework that encourages large institutions to direct their buying power toward five core values, which include local economies and environmental sustainability -- using the 2018-2019 school year for the baseline assessment. DC Greens and the DC Food Policy Council are leading a DC GFPP Coalition of organizations to try to get this policy implemented at a larger scale in DC. GFPP provisions have been included in proposed legislation (Healthy Students Amendment Act of 2017) before the DC Council. The Healthy Tots Act of 2014 reimburses childcare facilities participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) with an additional five cents reimbursement for each lunch or supper served that contains at least one component that meets the definition of a locally-grown, unprocessed food. CACFP claims reporting shows that 96,127 meals served in FY2019 included local foods. In 2019, DC Council introduced the Healthy Beverages Choices Amendment Act (Bill 23-495) that would implement a tax of 1.5 cents per ounce tax on the distribution of sugary drinks in the District. From these funds, the city would establish the Healthy People, Healthy Places Open Space Grant Program that would be administered by the Food Policy Council to support programming in parks and open space."}]}}

All of the meals and snacks served through the Summer Nutrition Programs must meet federal nutrition standards. The meals served through the SFSP require servings of grains, proteins, fruits and vegetables, and milk.No Township funds are needed or used to operate this program. CDBG funds are also used to pay for the part time seasonal staff and are used to make the initial purchase of the meals and eventually bereimbursed by PDE. 2.

The policies in the OCP are:(a) Support efforts to provide access to safe, affordable, nutritious, culturally acceptable food and nutrition education for all residents. (b) Support efforts to minimize the environmental impacts of food production, processing, storage, transport, preparation, and disposal. c) Support efforts to enrich Saskatoon's vibrant and diverse food culture. (d) Support efforts to produce food locally, as well as the development of urban agriculture throughout Saskatoon.The expected outcomes include promoting health, building communities, protecting the environment, and strengthening the economy by considering how food is grown, processed, distributed, acquired, and disposed of in the city and region.The City of Saskatoon's Green Infrastructure Strategy, received by City Council in February 2020, includes an urban agriculture section. The actions in this section are: 3.1: Update policies to improve urban agriculture outcomes and community or regional partnerships. 3.2: Work with partners to develop a comprehensive food strategy, including implementation of the Saskatoon Regional Food System Assessment and Action Plan. 3.3: Work with and support partners to incorporate food and fruit production or traditional food systems into high priority urban areas. 3.4: Identify potential sites and partners to develop a food forest pilot project.The expected outcome is increase food production in the Green Network, which will contribute to a Green Network that facilitates placemaking, honours culture, and inspires community-led transformation.The Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Waste Diversion Strategy, approved by Council in January 2020, includes actions to reduce food waste, in addition to waste diversion. The actions include:1: D. Provide education on waste reduction and additional waste diversion (which includes food waste reduction)4: A. Reduce Food Waste and increase reclamation through a coordinated approach.The expected outcome will be a reduction in food waste that is landfilled or would be required to be diverted through the regulation of organics waste for the Industrial, Commercial and Institutional sector."}]}}

DMPED specifically funded one of these -- Good Food Markets -- through a Neighborhood Prosperity Grant. DSLBD has also supported the Good Food Markets program through its own funding and technical assistance. The Food Policy Council has also begun research into how people East of the River are currently spending and where people are shopping. Big name grocers want to know about customer buying power, customer demand, and not just the information about the existing grocers sales East of the River, knowing that demand is lost to neighboring wards and jurisdictions. Mayor Bowser announced in September 2019 that DMPED and DGS should prioritize East of the River locations with grocery store anchors when considering office space for DC government agencies. The government can use its leasing power to be a development catalyst for communities experiencing underinvestment and needing retail. In 2019, the Produce Rx Pilot Program initiated between DC Greens, Giant, AmeriHealth, and DC Health that provided 500 residents with $20/week of fresh produce at the Ward 8 Giant, as well as a public-private partnership with Giant that saw a dietician onsite at the Ward 8 Giant to offer counseling and advice. DSLBD funded several DC Main Street programs' efforts to add healthier food options in local corner and small grocery stores (Wards 1, 4); participated as chairs of a sub working group of the Food Policy Council and the SEED Fellowship to work on supporting small grocery development and cooperatives; and made grants to corner stores through the Retail Readiness Grant to upgrade infrastructure to allow for more onsite refrigeration in Wards 7 and 8. The DC Health partnership with DC Central Kitchen (DCCK) continued throughout 2019. DCCK provides corner stores with technical assistance, shared marketing and outreach, as well as direct produce options, leading to improved food environments and healthful food availability in areas with low-access to healthy food options, with a focus on Wards 7 and 8. Retailer participation in the Healthy Corner Store Partnership reached 59 local retailers, increasing quantities and varieties of fresh and minimally processed healthful foods, and supporting increased food access to individuals. DCCK distributed more than 412,000 units of produce and healthy snacks and yielded $342,000 in healthy food sales for small local District retailers. To date, 1,327 children have participated in the Early Learners Market Share program, where community partner Community Foodworks aggregates fresh produce from local vendors to offer competitively priced fruits and vegetables to 42 childcare facilities that do not have the purchasing power to buy wholesale. A total of 80,000 servings of local produce were served to children through this program."}]}}

As the climate warms, the variance for water demand throughout the year will continue to increase. Not only will the warmer atmosphere be able to hold more water leading to less precipitation in the Southwest, especially in warm months, but also longer and more severe droughts as storm tracks shift northward leaving already arid climates even dryer. Additionally, with the climate warming, Boulder County is expecting to have more rain and less snow. This is a critical change because Boulder County depends on the gradual melting of snowpack to supply surface water through the warm months. More rain and less snow meas lower flows and greater water stress in summer. I think this description fits better in Row 1. Usually when we talk about increased water demand we're talking about increase in population, industry needs, agricultural consumption, and ecosystem needs (basically discussing all of the various demands on our water supplies, but for the front range, driven mostly by population growth)."}]}}

The principal water sources for Newcastle are Kielder and Catcleugh Reservoirs, and the River Tyne.Northumbrian Water has a statutory duty to prepare a Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP) under the Water Industry Act 1991. The plan outlines the company's approach to maintain a long-term sustainable supply and demand balance for the supply of water in the North East. It also takes into account climate change implications, and the potential effects of changes in population.Given the level of water resources assured by the Kielder Reservoir, there is 100% security of supply in Newcastle for the foreseeable future. This means that sufficient raw water resources should be available under all probable circumstances. As a result, metering for demand management is not a priority, but NWL still looks to minimise consumption to reduce carbon emissions.Newcastle is predominantly supplied from Horsley and Whittle Dene water treatment works in the Tyne Valley which produce a combined average output of approximately 200 million litres of water per day. Both treatment works have similar process streams incorporating chemical coagulation, clarification, rapid gravity filtration, Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) and disinfection using chlorine. Water samples are analysed under regulations monitored by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI). Water quality has been attested of being of extremely high standards for several decades now. Gradual increases in regional industrialised farming increased levels of pesticides in the local river catchments and raw water supply, meaning investment has been required to maintain water quality.NWL has worked closely with Ofwat and the Environment Agency (EA) to agree annual targets for water loss as we reach a Sustainable Economic Level of Leakage (the point where the marginal cost of saving an additional unit of water equals the marginal benefit derived from the water saved)."}]}}

The area's three major water suppliers, Fairfax Water, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), and the Washington Aqueduct Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Aqueduct) participate in a cooperative system of water supply planning and management. This includes joint funding of water supply storage in reservoirs located upstream of the suppliers' Potomac River intakes and coordinated operations when flows in the river fall below specified thresholds. This cooperative system is based on a set of agreements entered into more than 30 years ago. The Low Flow Allocation Agreement (LFAA) of 1978 specifies a formula for the allocation of water during shortages. The Water Supply Coordination Agreement (WSCA) of 1982 commits the three suppliers to operate \"in a coordinated manner\" to optimize the use of available resources and requires that long-term water demand and availability forecasts be conducted every five years. During periods of drought, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin (ICPRB) Section for Cooperative Water Supply Operations on the Potomac (CO-OP) helps manage this system by coordinating WMA water withdrawals from the Potomac River and off-river reservoirs. CO-OP also recommends releases from upstream reservoirs when forecasted flow in the river is not sufficient to meet expected needs. Each year when flows are at or above normal, CO-OP conducts a drought exercise. These exercises allow participants to practice and improve communication procedures among organizations and also provide ICPRB's CO-OP staff with an opportunity to practice using operational tools and making management decisions. This ensures that during an actual drought all stakeholders are properly trained and key operational strategies have been discussed and tested beforehand. Through the efforts coordinated through the ICPROB, the regional water utilities continue to review drought management practices that will conserve water storage in both local and upstream reservoirs."}]}}

These wells have the potential to be greatly impacted by drought conditions. The first to be affected are the shallow aquifers that will experience limited recharge and increased demand. For the Greensville Rural Settlement Area we completed a detailed Water Budget as the assessment of the source revealed a high degree of stress within the subwatershed and shown that under drought conditions of (only) 2 years the shallow wells can experience a drop in water levels of 7m. This drop is considered significant as some of the residential wells do not have a great water column available or the well cannot be operated at very low water levels. Also an increase in extreme weather events is expected to increase flooding and soil erosion. This will result in degraded surface water quality due to the suspension of sediments, nutrients and pesticides."}]}}

The District has been self-governing since 1973 and has budget autonomy that allows spending of local dollars without inclusion of the District's budget into an approved federal budget. All legislation, however, must undergo a 30-day passive Congressional review period before taking effect, and the United States Congress maintains the power to overturn local laws. As the nation's capital and seat of the Federal government, the District has a significant Federal and international presence; while the District works to partner with foreign embassies and federal agencies around sustainability efforts, local building requirements around efficiency do not apply."}]}}

The Mayor's Office of Sustainability develops strategies, policies and programs relating to climate mitigation in NYC, while the Office of Recovery and Resiliency is charged with climate adaptation planning for the City. Mayor's Office of Sustainability - Climate Change Mitigation: In September 2014, New York City committed to 80 x 50, with an interim target to reduce emissions 40 percent by 2030 (40 x 30), joining the world's leading cities in doing our part to reduce our contributions to catastrophic climate change. Achieving this goal requires significant reductions in emissions produced by the city's energy supply, buildings, transportation, and solid waste. The City committed billions of dollars to reduce its carbon footprint with investments in energy efficiency for municipal buildings. We also released One New York: the Plan for A Strong and Just City (OneNYC) in April 2015, laying the blueprint for inclusive climate action for all New Yorkers across four key visions of Growth, Equity, Sustainability, and Resiliency. In OneNYC, we reaffirmed our commitment to 80 x 50 with new investments in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and solid waste management that help improve air quality across the city and catalyze an important shift away from carbon-intensive sources of energy. To determine a pathway to achieving 80 x 50, the City conducted an integrated analysis to examine the maximum potential GHG reductions from the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors. The results of this analysis were released in September 2016 in New York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50, a comprehensive report based on the best available science and state-of-the-art GHG emissions modeling to assess what will be necessary to reach 80 x 50. The analysis found that with the commitments in OneNYC and related efforts, the City is already implementing policies and programs that will significantly reduce GHG emissions. These initiatives, once fully realized, along with existing state and federal level policies and market trends, put the City on track to achieve an interim target of a 40 percent reduction by 2030 (40 x 30). The City's analysis also shows that the projected impact of these efforts will make it possible to bend the curve on GHG emissions; however, these efforts alone are not enough to reach 80 x 50. We must continue to do more to reduce emissions in New York City and lead progress across the globe in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Office of Recovery and Resiliency - Climate Change Adaptation: In March 2014, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the establishment of the Office of Recovery and Resiliency (ORR). This Office leads the City's efforts to build a stronger, more resilient New York by implementing recommendations laid out in A Stronger, More Resilient New York (<URL>) and in 2015's One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City. The plan builds on the foundations of public collaboration and rigorous analysis. ORR will guide the City's work as we: strengthen coastal defenses, upgrade buildings, protect infrastructure and critical services, and make our homes, businesses, and neighborhoods safer and more vibrant."}]}}

The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (Compact) began in 2010 as a collaborative effort among Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, their municipalities, and their partners. The purpose of the Compact is to unite, organize, and assess the southeast Florida region through the lens of climate change and develop unified action over the next five years. In October 2012, the Compact released the Regional Climate Action Plan (RCAP) with the overall objective to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation into existing decision-making systems and to develop a plan that can be implemented through existing local and regional agencies, processes and organizations. The RCAP provides a framework to help guide policies and serves as a living document with options that each regional or local government may adopt and utilize based on their interests and vision of the future. In February 2013, the City Commission adopted Resolution No. 2013-28142 approving the implementation of the Compact's RCAP and endorsing the Mayors' Climate Action Pledge. In 2016, Miami Beach, as part of Greater Miami and the Beaches, was selected to join the 100 Resilient Cities network. As part of the network, the City will have access to tools and services in areas such as innovative finance, technology, infrastructure, land use and community and social resilience.The City of Miami Beach is facing unique challenges and is responding to them using novel approaches. Miami Beach is regarded as an internationally renowned destination so the City's climate change adaptation strategies are being observed worldwide."}]}}

Cities are now responsible for the production of about 70% of Greenhouse Gases. The Municipality of Jesus Maria, within the framework of this reality and aligning itself with the Sustainable Development Objectives, has decided to adapt its model and agenda to adopt measures to improve its citizens' quality of life and the sustainability of the district. The Municipality seeks to reduce GHGs in the district, minimize its dependence on fossil fuels, improve its efficiency, and increase its resilience. The cost to local governments of not implementing strategies and deciding to change their agendas is increasing. The Municipality of Jesus Maria also understands that action implies having a plan that covers environmental aspects and social and even economic ones. In that sense, acting also means expanding the opportunities to promote the increase of green jobs, the whole team's innovation, and strengthening the link with the population, making them participate across the entire line of work (UN, 2020).In this context, The Climate Action Plan for Jesus Maria is an immense opportunity to join efforts and make Jesus Maria a sustainable, accessible, inclusive, and resilient district in Latin America and the world. The Climate Action Plan focuses on establishing Adaptation and Resilience measures as well as Mitigation measures, a roadmap to 2030. How is the Municipality of Jesus Maria preparing to reduce vulnerability to imminent climate change By focusing its strategies on pillars such as water responsibility and the conservation of green areas. What will the Municipality of Jesus Maria do to reduce the Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the whole territory Work to introduce a green economy, sustainable urban spaces, and initiate a change towards energy efficiency--everything, adaptation, and mitigation measures, with the population's clear commitment."}]}}

Citizens had the opportunity to provide their comments and around 2,300 contributions were received, evaluated and incorporated into the document.The strategy had a strong focus on sustainability and promoted: 1. an economic relaunch in line with environmental transition objectives (equity, decarbonization, re-naturalization and resilience) 2. the improvement of air quality through the promotion of sustainable mobility 3. local production and short food supply chains, as well as the application of the principles of circular economy to resources management. Moreover, \"Milano 2020\" endorsed the re-organization of local services with a view to create a 15-minute city. <URL> implementation of the adaptation strategy has included the following complementary projects and initiatives:-\"Strade Aperte\" (Open Streets), a plan to rapidly create and test infrastructures for pedestrian and cycling mobility through signals and temporary road furniture, connecting the city center to peripheral districts. From May to December 2020, about 35 km of new temporary bike lanes were realized (in addition to those already planned), as well as numerous 30 km/h zones. The new cycle routes enhance existing connections with the main public transport hubs, thus offering an alternative mode of transport to work to both residents and commuters. <URL> of \"Piazze Aperte\" (Open Squares), with the creation and test of additional pedestrian and social spaces (20 in total) through light tactical urban planning interventions, in particular near schools and public services facilities in neighborhoods with fewer green areas and lack of common spaces, providing open spaces for sociality and cooling-\"Play Street\", experimentation of temporary pedestrianization of streets close to schools in neighborhoods with limited or poor-quality green areas to facilitate children's and families' physical and social activity and game in the schools surroundings. Test of the first Play Street in Rogoredo during the last days of the school year -Creation of new pedestrian areas, pedestrian priority areas (max 15 km/h in residential streets) and 500 free parklets/streateries, i.e. bar and restaurants' tables instead of parking. More than 2000 permissions for the occupation of public land, covering more than 40.000 sqm, have been granted to support local economy and give citizens new public open spaces when it was not possible to stay indoors-Together with the Chamber of Commerce, launch of a Call for Proposals on Air Quality, for the funding of both the development and the adoption of innovative projects aimed at developing solutions to control/reduce polluting emissions, especially by using digital technologies. <URL> of a massive retrofitting plan for the public housing building stock (76 areas, 680 buildings involved) to upgrade envelopes and facilities of at least two energy-classes per building and further improve energy saving-Two urban regeneration programmes for public housing neighbourhoods in the districts of Gorla and Corvetto (28 million Euros national funds)-Equitable incentives for the improvement of energy efficiency of approved buildings-Bonus for the maintenance of heating systems (for both the energy efficiency and the safety of the heating system)-Acceleration of the definition of the Depaving Program with the goal of increasing green or permeable space for the population' use by reducing unused or car space-Opening of new Neighborhood Food Hubs against Food Waste for the collection and redistribution of excess food from supermarkets and company canteens; strengthening of active initiatives in the collection and redistribution of excess food from the fruit market and school canteens-Development of short food supply chains for institutional supplies, large-scale distribution and farmer's marketsThe City of Milan has also initiated a path towards the decarbonization and reduction of air pollution in the construction sector, starting from the assessment of the local situation and the drafting of a roadmap, with the support of C40 and Buro Happold.In April 2020 the Mayor of Milan, together with C40 Cities, launched the Global Mayors COVID-19 Recovery Task Force to drive forward a sustainable and fair recovery that could improve public health, reduce inequality and address the climate crisis at the same time. <URL> a view to strengthen the efforts to ensure that the recovery from the pandemic leaves no one behind, Milan also joined the C40-MMC Global Mayors Task Force on Climate and Migration (<URL>) and C40 Inclusive Climate Action Forum"}]}}

Some of these measures includedBan on public transport, this reduced on the rate of air pollution especially in the city center which always and high vehicular congestion, Ban private vehicles, this also reduced the air pollution, Limited production, less air travel, commuting, walk to work, less vehicular movement, closure of schools, bars, trading business centers, closure of SME and industrial parks, reduction in commercial activity at brick-and-mortar shops among others. All these have positively impacted on the city's climate through improving of ai quality, sanitation, hygiene among other benefits hence contributing to the long-term climate goals of the Paris Agreement of reducing emissions."}]}}

The Plan for Plan for Climate and Sustainability 2020-2030 supports the Vision 2030 and includes 11 sub-goals regarding energy savings, sustainable heating and transport, local renewable energy production, climate adaptation, biodiversity, waste management, climate education, procurement policy etc. To meet the climate goals the municipality has gathered forces with citizens and businesses, e.g. in the One Planet project where local companies are involved in climate planning (finalised ultimo 2020).The Climate and Sustainability Plan 2020-2030 also addresses the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The Sustainable Development Goals work as an underlying principles on which the Municipal Plan builds upon. Hence, the Climate and Sustainability Plan specifically addresses a number of the goals.An annex to the plan includes a report based on C40's 'Climate Action Planning Framework'. The annex ensures that the plan's goals regarding both emissions reduction and climate adaption aligns with the goals in the Paris Agreement.A number of other plans supports the Municipality's visions on climate, nature and sustainability, for instance the Biodiversity Plan 2019-2030, which is focusing on enhancing nature and biodiversity."}]}}

Scotland's Zero Waste Plan sets out the Scottish Government's vision for a zero waste society, and envisages that, by 2025, 70 per cent of all waste will be recycled and a maximum of 5 per cent sent to landfill.The council's Resource and Recycling strategy sets out how the city will divert waste from landfill, achieve its recycling targets and reduce their carbon footprint, contributing to Scotland's ambition of becoming a zero waste nation.CDP 5 - Development of Waste Management Facilities for Managing and Recycling Waste.City Development Plan Policy CDP5 is intended to help deliver these ambitions by safeguarding the existing and proposed Waste Transfer Stations/recycling centres and setting out considerations for determining the acceptability of new waste management/recycling operations. Policy CDP1 addresses the design of new development to help provide for waste separation and collection.A renewed focus on the need to adopt the principles of the waste hierarchy (reduce and re-use of materials) is one of the most important ways in which we can help meet our carbon-reduction targets, while creating a more sustainable and circular economy. The city council have recently adopted a new Resource and Recycling Strategy which aims to address these issues in light of national legislation, including the new deposit and return scheme. The national Zero Waste Scotland Strategy aims to embed the principles of a circular economy and a zero-waste society. This means minimising the population's demand on primary resources and maximising the reuse, recycling and recovery of resources. The city will kick start ambitious targets for creating a more circular economy through the recent adoption of the Circular Economy Route map and the city's .To reduce the impact of waste in the city, Glasgow will lead by example in phasing out all single use plastics by 2022. The Plastic reduction Strategy will pilot this approach by working to achieve three plastic-free schools and delivering a plastic-free shopping zone before 2025."}]}}

The Climate Action Plan is divided in two parts: (a) the mitigation plan and (b) the adaptation plan. The mitigation plan focuses on the reduction of GHG emissions by 40% until 2030 in comparison to 2014 levels. According to this plan, actions on energy savings and thus GHG emissions reduction are put forward on buildings in the municipal, commercial and residential sector, transport and industry. Actions on the process of solid waste are also put forward, so as to reduce GHG emissions from landfills. The adaptation plan sets actions on the city's adaptation to climate change at technical and social level, focusing mainly on heatwaves. The adaptation actions are about making public spaces cooler and greener, making buildings greener (facades and roofs), saving water from irrigation, as well as protecting public health and mainly vulnerable groups.These texts can be found at: <URL> and <URL> Summaries in English are on pages 10-11 and 8-9, respectively."}]}}

This fund is designed to raise mainly private financing and invest it in SMEs with high growth potential that will develop innovative solutions for Paris and its inhabitants in the areas of ecological transition (building, mobility, energy, air quality, circular economy, etc.). There is a territorial component to this fund, in the sense that these solutions must be able to be deployed in Paris or in similar cities and/or the SME must be Parisian.In July 2018, Paris fonds vert raised its first EUR100 million. The subscribers were public and private institutions and industrialists. In June 2019, IES, the world leader in rapid recharging solutions for electric vehicles, announced that it had raised 10 million euros from Paris Fonds Vert. The objective of this fund raising is to enable IES to accelerate its development in France and internationally, thus contributing to the development of sustainable and low carbon mobility. In September 2019, ALTEREA Group announces a fund raising of 5 million euros from Paris Fonds Vert. The objective of this fund raising is to enable the Group to continue to structure itself and accelerate its development, thus contributing to the challenge of reducing the energy and environmental footprint of buildings."}]}}

In 2015 Enova, Australia's first community owned renewable energy retailing and installation business, was launched in the region. New Electric Vehicle and electric bike businesses have also been rapidly growing in the area. An economic assessment of renewable energy resources across the Byron Shire showed that whilst wind turbines weren't a viable option for the region, solar had a strong financial basis for expansion.

Allen Grant has ended. The program, a collaboration between the City of Columbus and the Columbus Partnership, had great success reaching its private electric vehicle consumer adoption goals by building strong relationships with businesses, local car dealerships, and original equipment manufacturers. However, long term funding for this program following the completion of the $10 million Paul G. Allen grant has not been identified. Further background on the program follows: In 2016, Columbus won the Department of Transportation's first ever Smart City Challenge. Granted $50 million, the city was tasked with developing a sustainable, connected, and equitable transportation ecosystem, a project known as Smart Columbus. Public, private, academic, and non-profit partners are working to expand mass and shared transportation options, to reduce single occupancy vehicle ownership and travel, to increase electric vehicle adoption, and install electric vehicle charging infrastructure. This past year has seen the launch of the Smart Columbus Operating System, an Open Data Platform which provides anytime access to the city's latest mobility data, and the first step towards vehicle autonomy, as well as the Smart Columbus Experience Center, an interactive public-facing education space. In addition to the original grant funds, an Acceleration Fund, made up of coordinated and aligned investments by the private and public sectors that will complement, scale and sustain Smart Columbus projects and programs into the future. Columbus will serve as the Smart City model for North America and produce a Smart Cities Playbook that other communities can use to guide their own Smart City and Transportation initiatives.The second program year of the Smart Columbus Electrification Program sponsored by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation in March 2019, with our outreach strategies strong. Since the beginning of 2017, the cumulative new electric vehicle registrations in the Columbus region have increased by 121%. Columbus' growth in new EV registrations have outpaced the 82% expansion in the Midwest region and 94% seen across the U.S. over the same time period. We feel that our programs and strategies that target employees of central Ohio's largest employers are aligned with what the public needs to transform their car purchases.Educating the community about the future possibilities of mobility is one of our top priorities, it is important for us to have a destination where people can come to get hands-on experience with smart technology being tested in the city and learn about the benefits of EVs. In June 2018, we opened the Smart Columbus Experience Center in downtown Columbus on the Scioto Mile. The Experience Center includes a 3,000 square foot showroom with interactive displays from our partners, and EVs that people can test drive on the spot. It also houses a worksite for our partner organizations, with more than 40 dedicated employees who work in an additional 3,000 square feet space. Since opening, more than 7,200 visitorsincluding folks from more than 30 cities spanning seven countries have visited the Experience Center and we've hosted more than 260 EV test drives."}]}}

Furthermore, the municipality has areas with contaminated soil, which must bemanaged to avoid spread during floods and contribute to a resilient and sustainable builtenvironment. The project Smart plants in the service of climate investigates how plants can be used to bindcarbon, promote biodiversity, even out temperature and water flows and accumulate soil pollution.The project aims to test and develop cost-effective and scalable methods for carbon dioxideuptake and purification of contaminated soil. Other purposes include increasing public awarenessand knowledge about climate adaptation through communication initiatives, as well asinvestigating new business models for local climate compensation."}]}}

It sets the target of 1.5 tonnes CO2e/capita by 2023 as an interim goal to have net zero emissions by 2040. A special action plan for the road transport sector is produced during 2020. An updated CAP will be produced after 2023 in order to stick to the curve towards zero emissions. Of special importance is the development of large scale carbon sinks in the form of bio-CCS plants connected to the district heating. Because of the extensive use of bio-energy for heat and power production in Stockholm, the potential for negative emissions is about 1 million tonnes/year. A pilot plant for bio-CCS was set up in 2019, and the Stockholm Exergi Company now plans for a full scale plant in 2025. Acquiring financing for this through national Swedish and European funds is cruicial. Depending on the technological assessment of the bio-CCS technology and the availability of external funding, climate neutrality may occur before 2040. Please note that Stockholm first and foremost works to phase out all use of fossil energy, and secondly to establish negative emissions in order to off-set the last remaining residual emissions."}]}}

Resilience hubs are community facilities, open year-round to provide information on services, events, and resources that help residents build the skills and connections necessary to be better prepared for emergencies. During emergency events, resilience hubs can be converted into 24-hour locations that provide needed services such as food and water, internet access, charging stations, heat and air conditioning, basic first aid, refrigeration for medications, cleaning supplies, and important recovery information. In 2018 the District Department of Energy and Environment, in partnership with local partner Georgetown Climate Center, conducted a year-long effort to support residents living in one of the most climate vulnerable parts of the District in determining their vision for a resilient and sustainable community. The project relied on an \"Equity Advisory Group\" (EAG) of thirteen residents, chosen to be demographically representative of the community. One of the key recommendations to come out of this group was to develop a community Resilience Hub. This year, DOEE and public partner Green Scheme received funding to convene another community committee that will help decide potential hub siting and services offered at the beginning of the development process."}]}}

The result of the process of the public meetings was that the number of sustainability goals increased from 6 to 10 in the final plan. The work with the community part of the municipal plan revealed that Arendal must make a biodiversity plan. There is an increased need for business areas. This means increased pressure on untouched nature. The municipal plan states that ensuring a green structure and climate adaptation is becoming an increasingly important task in planning.A number of meetings have been held in the Volunteer Centres (Frivillighetssentalene), coordinated by \"With the heart for Arendal\" (Med Hjerte for Arendal) together with the municipality. It has been public meetings and work meetings in schools, in institutions for the elderly, in the library, at adult education and neighbourhoods. In addition, there have been separate events for children and adolescents. The children's representative in the municipality has been included in the assessment of the input from children and adolescents. Many have provided input via email and Social Media. All input is gathered in \"The Digital Meeting\".An analysis of the input in the digital conference shows that the citizens are especially concerned with the topics: public services for children and young people, inclusion in the labour market, traffic and public transport, social life, nature as a resource and various organisations role in the work to make Arendal more sustainable.The population has made important contributions to the new municipal plan."}]}}

The Bay supports rare and endangered marine mammals, turtles and a high diversity of bird species. These habits are threatened by heavy pollution from nutrient run-off and domestic and industrial materials resulting in high concentrations of heavy metals. There is also evidence of eutrophication. Climate change is anticipated to exacerbate this, with periods of drought reducing discharge rates in freshwater bodies which will reduce the natural environments capacity to manage the pollution. This is coupled with more extreme precipitation events which will increase nutrient run-off during more intense, higher magnitude events. Furthermore, demand for marine goods and services, such as food, energy, and habitats, usually exceed the capacity of marine areas."}]}}

According to Jesus Maria's meteorological records, temperatures during February reached 30.6 degC. The district has green areas above the average at the metropolitan level (8m2/inhabitant) but still below the world average. The trees and green spaces in the urban space not only define to a great extent the identity and attractiveness of the cities, but these open spaces also contribute to the quality of life of its inhabitants. Besides, the generation of green corridors in the district helps to reduce heat islands and helps to reduce the loss of biodiversity. This line of Action addresses the danger of Heatwaves in co-benefit for the danger of Droughts. 100% of the population will benefit from the nine zones of the district. Short term actions (2020-2022)1. Prepare an updated Inventory of trees and green areas in the district.2. To promote the registration of green areas and tree nets. 3. Analyze and prepare a report in coordination with Minagri for the selection of tree species suitable for shade. 4. Increase the number of shaded areas in the district to public areas such as parks and close to public transport stops or waiting areas.5. Evaluate proposals for natural pergolas as shade areas in places where tree species cannot be planted. 6. Establish a recovery program for public parks where the green area prevails over the cement. 7. Generation of new green areas in the district. 8. Establish a program of integrated pest control in green areas. 9. To promote a program of control of fauna and biodiversity.10. Analyze a proposal for a network of urban green corridors articulated with the network at the metropolitan level. Medium and long-term actions (2023-2030)11. Establish a program of safe relocation of the tree-lined network in possible danger.12. Establish neighborhood dialogue tables for the creation of a network of urban corridors. 13. Promote an evaluation of the sectorization of green areas according to temperature, vulnerable population, and irrigation capacity. 14. Generation of a catalog of tree species, fauna, and biodiversity in the district. Monitoring indicators:Area of green (total hectares and hectares/inhabitant)Proximity of green (percentage of population within 5 minutes of a quality green space).Number of tree species by type. Percentage of tree species relocated and recovered.Number of pest control interventions carried out."}]}}

City staff and consultants modeled various scenarios of future carbon emissions, taking into account population changes and statewide policies. The team developed strategies to estimate the potential carbon reductions of Santa Monica's future efforts. These measures were prioritized by the Steering Committee. Presentations were given at 19 community andbusiness meetings reaching approximately 300 people. These included various meetings of neighborhood associations, community organizations, church groups, business improvement districts and business events. Climate Action Santa Monica, a grassroots climate organization, leads the 'Climate Corps' program offering summer internship and volunteer opportunities for students and young adults, The Climate Corps gauge resident and visitors' concerns about climate change issues and support for the City's climate policies. Augmented reality viewers were installed on the Santa Monica Pier, providing residents and visitors a view into a future with sea level rise. Over 10,000 participants were surveyed on their climate change concerns and adaptation preferences. In 2016, Santa Monica held its first ever Community Climate Action Summit, inviting residents, visitors and businesses to contribute to the plan. Over 250 individuals participated in the day-long event filled with expert speakers, interactive workshops, open discussion and exhibitors. Following on the success of the Community Climate Action Summit, the City held ClimateFest in May 2018. The event featured localexperts on climate policy and provided accessible resources for individual climate action. Over 600 people attended, interacting with various themes of the plan."}]}}

Yet, we know that socially vulnerable groups reside in the most vulnerable areas subject to climate change hazards. The highest priority adaptation strategy called for in the CAP Update is to provide education and conduct outreach in the community. With this priority identified and armed with the two new analyses, the City's Climate Action Program seized the opportunity to design an outreach campaign focused on connecting with vulnerable communities. As outlined in the City's Climate Adaptation Outreach Campaign Plan, the City's Climate Action Program conducted a broad based 9 month outreach campaign to share the findings of these studies and engage residents in a solutions based dialogue on adaptation responses. Over 50 diverse events were scheduled including hosting informational events at senior housing complexes, our library's Spanish Language story time, Meals on Wheels dining sites, farmers' markets and an annual Vive Oaxaca Guelaguetza festival. Community members had an opportunity to take action through community coastal restoration workdays and individual action sheets. Additionally, the campaign's fact sheets, frequently asked questions, interactive activities, individual action sheets, and the draft and final CAP Update were translated into Spanish and made available online, at our library's main branch, and at our community events. The City is also scured funding to develop and launch a virtual reality based climate adaptation outreach app that will be promoted to socially vulnerable residents."}]}}

This objective arises from the problems due to the high density of Milan, which clearly hinders the widespread insertion of permeable areas, especially in the center, and determines the discharge of rainwater directly into the sewer. As the title of the objective suggests, the measures adopted must allow natural drainage and rain retention, retaining as much as possible in the soil: this allows not only the reduction of the hydraulic risk, but also the enhancement of the water resource through its storage, which in turn leads to a reduction in the use of infrastructure for the disposal of waste water. This objective does not limit itself to coping with the increase in the intensity of the rains, but improves the management of a particularly important resource both for people and for the urban plant heritage, supposed to expand considerably thanks to the forestation program ForestaMi."}]}}

In Salvador ProAdapta developed several studies regarding the city's vulnerability index and the implementation of Ecosystem-based adaptation/ Nature based Solutions. The Identification and analysis of elements of Urban Infrastructure and Green Infrastructure to deal with risks linked to climate change at the municipal, such as adaptation based on ecosystems study was presented to leaders and members of several secretariats, in addition to partners and researchers, pointing out the possibilities of green infrastructure for adapting to climate change based on ecosystems in vulnerable communities in Salvador - Bahia, proposing pilot projects in communities. The Nature Based Solutions studies helped the city to adopt several of these solutions on its new infrastructure projects, such as in the revitalization of Mane Dende, with the implementation of green roofs, the use of natural ventilation and solar light to diminsh energy consumption and the increase in green areas. In addition, nature based solutions are being adopted in many infrastructural projects in the city."}]}}

During the May 2019 workshop, there was a community open house to review and provide feedback on the visions that were being sketched for three specific neighborhoods. The recommendations from this process primarily informed the Bayou chapter of Resilient Houston."}]}}

He advised and guided the group that this goal should be met through a lens of social and racial equity. A group of City, nonprofit, and community experts developed a process for evaluation all city-owned properties for potential use as public green space or parks and gave greater weight to those in areas with higher proportions of residents facing vulnerability to climate impacts due to race and ethnicity, poverty, and other factors. The city has since officially identified five parcels of land as new parks spaces and is working with the community to turn this raw land into usable, community-oriented green spaces."}]}}

A correlation seems to exist between gender and mortality rates during heatwaves, in fact during 2003 Paris heatwave, mortality rates were greater among women, whilst a very high rate was discovered among working men, which suggests that the working environment influences vulnerability.Heatwaves also cause higher energy demand for cooling by creating a general discomfot. In the last years. this fact forced the energy management agency (Unareti) to issue a warning to reduce energy consumption in order to prevent blackouts: in 2015, due to the high temperature, a peak in energy demand was registered in the city (1.625 MW), causing several failures in the energy distribution network."}]}}

There are strong negative effects on inhabitants' socialisation, children's need to play outdoors in playgrounds and open spaces. There is also the danger of the potential use of public spaces for illegal activities, due to their abandonment during high temperatures. Furthermore, due to the energy poverty that many households face in the Municipality of Athens and the lack of air conditioning in many dwellings, in relation to the aged building stock, thermal discomfort can be observed in many buildings. This can lead to high morbidity and mortality risks of vulnerable groups of the population.During the past few years, the hot period starts earlier in spring and finishes later in autumn, leading to an increased number of hot days. Studies show that the number of days with temperatures more than 37-40oC has increased significantly after the 1990s. Electricity demand for cooling raises, while there are negative impacts mainly on vulnerable population's health and generally decrease in people's activities in the commercial city centre. These trends will deteriorate if appropriate measures are not taken.It is expected that the average annual temperature will rise be from 0.28oC to 1.60oC during the period 2031-2050 (Risk Assessment Athens, 2021).In Athens, the decade 2011-2020 has been the warmest one that has been monitored, since the mid 19th century (Founda and Pierros, 2021)References:Founda D., and Pierros F.

While the City is updating its stormwater management system with new pump stations, the old system is still gravity driven. These older systems lead to slow drainage from streets which may cause extended flooding in streets and properties.

As some of the largest refineries in the nation are located within a short distance of Galveston Bay, storm surges have the ability to greatly impact the nation's gasoline prices and an extended shutdown of Houston-area refineries would likely cause shortages of fuel and pose a national security risk. About 13% of the nation's petroleum products are refined in the Houston area. Additionally, the high concentration of refineries and chemical manufacturing operations can cause toxic releases into the air and water. After Hurricane Harvey, more than 90 chemical releases were reported and estimated to have involved more than 700,000 gallons of pollutants being released into the water, and 38,000 pounds of pollutants being released into the air."}]}}

It is estimated that \"Hurricane Katrina-like\" storm would cause aggregate losses to the Texas economy of $73 billion in gross product, $61.3 billion in income and 863,000 jobs. Hurricane Ike in 2008 cost the region $30 billion in damages and Hurricane Harvey is estimated to have cost $125 billion. As some of the largest refineries in the nation are located within a short distance of Galveston Bay, storm surges have the ability to greatly impact the nation's gasoline prices and a extended shutdown of the Houston area's refineries would likely cause shortages of fuel, posing a national security risk. About 13% of the nation's petroleum products are refined in the Houston area. Additionally, the high concentration of refineries and chemical manufacturing operations can cause an toxic releases into the air and water. After Hurricane Harvey, more than 90 chemical releases were reported and estimated to have involved more than 700,000 gallons of pollutants being released into the water, and 38,000 pounds of pollutants being released into the air."}]}}

Over the last century, aquifers in this area have lost between 300 and 400 feet, leaving some of the land to collapse. Spring Branch, where Interstate 10 and Beltway 8 meet, has dropped four feet since 1975. Jersey Village, at US 290 and Beltway 8, is almost two feet lower than it was in 1996. And Greater Greenspoint, where Interstate 45 intersects with Beltway 8, has given up about two feet in the last decade, according to USGS data.Also according to the USGS, while some areas in Houston have significantly reduced their groundwater pumping (particularly with the creation of subsidence and groundwater districts, whose purpose is to regulate groundwater pumping), subsidence remains a threat for the region."}]}}

The number of days with rainfall greater than 1.25\" has increased, with seven of the 12 wettest years occurring in the last three decades. The annual maximum of 5-day and 15-day rainfall had unusually high values in the recent 30-year period. The frequency of wetter than average spring seasons has also increased. Weather hazards threaten Iowa City's infrastructure and the safety and well-being of its population, and these hazards have become more numerous since 1981. Iowa City's risk profile has expanded rather than narrowed due to both an increased frequency of some hazardous weather conditions and an increased range of weather conditions. Recent changes that have expanded the risk profile include:* Increase in summer temperature, particularly the frequency of warm nights* Hotter nights, higher average temperature, and higher heat index during heat waves* Increase in frequency of number of days with excessive rainfall, excessively wet annual maximum 5-day and 15-day rainfall, and excessively wet springs and summersOther weather threats have been less frequent in recent years but are projected to emerge going forward. Recent data series are too short to discern a permanent change in these weather threats, but with 10 to 20 years of monitoring, it may be possible to conclude exposure to the following threats has changed:* Late spring freeze* Early fall freeze* Cold waves* Extreme cold waves"}]}}

Largely unobstructed either by rules or by natural features such as mountains, the Houston area sprawled. Nearly 25,000 acres of natural wetlands were developed between 1992 and 2010, mostly in Harris County. Between 1992 and 2010 alone nearly 30% of wetlands in Harris County were destroyed due to development. The region is low lying and with soil that is mostly clay based, causing the region to be naturally prone to flooding and drainage problems. The area's bayous have largely functioned as the storm water management and drainage systems. However, development in the area and over wetlands threaten this natural drainage mechanism. As Houston is rapidly expanding-- the population in Houston and the surrounding cities is expected to grow by 66.7% by 2040-- land use planning poses a huge challenge to manage the cities development and drainage needs, and to adapt to changing flood plains."}]}}

Largely unobstructed either by rules or by natural features such as mountains, the Houston area sprawled. Nearly 25,000 acres of natural wetlands were developed between 1992 and 2010, mostly in Harris County. Between 1992 and 2010 alone nearly 30% of wetlands in Harris County were destroyed due to development. The region is low lying and with soil that is mostly clay-based, causing the region to be naturally prone to flooding and drainage problems. The area's bayous have largely functioned as storm water management and drainage systems. However, development in the area and over wetlands threaten this natural drainage mechanism. As Houston is rapidly expanding-- the population in Houston and the surrounding cities is expected to grow by 66.7% by 2040-- land use planning poses a huge challenge to manage the cities development and drainage needs, and to adapt to changing flood plains."}]}}

Salvador is already suffering from extreme daily rain events. In April 2020, for example, the city recorded, in one day, 1/3 of rain expected for the month, which means approximately 100mm. The analysis shows a tendency to reduce rainfall in the city of Salvador in the analyzed time series and points to an increase in interannual variability, that is, years of excess rain are projected much above the current normal and years of rain deficit much below normal . According to projections, the periods of consecutive days without rain will be longer, as well as the consecutive periods with rain will be shorter. The models indicate that the extreme daily rain events will occur with increasing accumulations. It is noteworthy that the projections of accumulated 5 days of rain show an increase over the 21st century, making the areas of the upper level of the municipality of Salvador more vulnerable to landslides, since there are declining slopes."}]}}

Since Mayor Bowser took office, more than 1,000 young people have participated in the District's programs, with many participants going on to land jobs in the fields of energy and environment.The DC Infrastructure Academy (DCIA) is a partnership between DC Government and utility, union, university, and private sector partners that will provide a pipeline to in-demand infrastructure jobs. In 2017, the District had nearly a 50% shortage in the local infrastructure job market, which is set to grow 11% by 2021. Opened in 2018, the DCIA will provide high-quality, specialized trainings and other workforce development programs that help District residents secure high-paying, long-term employment in the infrastructure industry, with a focus on serving underemployed and unemployed residents. The Academy brings multiple infrastructure partners under one roof and include partners such as Pepco Exelon, Washington Gas, WMATA, DC Water and the University of the District of Columbia.The Green Zone Environmental Program (GZEP) is one of the nation's largest summer green jobs training programs for youth and young adults. Every summer, the Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) partners with the Department of Employment Services (DOES) and the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program to provide over 300 young Washingtonians, ages 14 to 24, with an opportunity to learn about energy and environmental issues, complete community-based environmental work projects, and prepare for careers.DOEE and DOES launched Solar Works DC as a pilot in the summer of 2016, and in July 2017, Mayor Bowser officially launched Solar Works DC as a year-round solar systems installation and job training program. Through Solar Works DC, the District will increase the city's solar capacity, reduce energy costs for income-qualified District homeowners, and train a qualified workforce who can enter jobs in the solar and related industries. Solar Works DC will provide training for over 200 District residents and install solar systems on up to 300 homesStarting in 2016, River Corps began offering job training in green infrastructure and conservation to DC residents. The program provides field experience and classroom instruction, including job readiness training, certifications, and career development opportunities. Participants engage in monitoring DC streams, invasive species management, and inspection and maintenance of RiverSmart homes and other bio-retention and low-impact development sites. Participants are also exposed to a diverse range of skill-building and professional development workshops and activities.In 2014, the DC Sustainable Energy Utility (DCSEU) launched the Workforce Development initiative to provide mentorship opportunities for entry-level professionals. The initiative places externs with seasoned mentors for experiential learning in energy efficiency. In FY18, the DC SEU created 88 jobs through their programming."}]}}

The data is publicly disclosed by DOEE. To facilitate benchmarking, the District of Columbia mandated (in the Sustainable DC Act of 2014) that both electric and gas utilities provide aggregated whole-building data upon request to a building owner, and make that data available as a download and through automated upload to ENERGY STAR\u00ae\ufe0f Portfolio Manager\u00ae\ufe0f. The District was the first jurisdiction in the U.S. to put such a requirement into law. The law is now fully phased in and nearly half of the District's total floor area is covered by the benchmarking and disclosure requirements. The Clean Energy DC Omnibus Amendment Act of 2018 expanded the requirements to include buildings that are 25,000 SF or more in 2021 and 10,000 SF or more in 2024. Private building performance has improved from 2014-2018. The weather-normalized Site EUI for 1578 private buildings in the District fell 1.0% from 2014-2018, decreasing 5.5% in office buildings, by 3.0% in hotels, but rising in multifamily buildings by 7%, and colleges/universities by 8.2%. (It should be noted that the College/University building analysis only included buildings that self-designated as \"College/University\" in Portfolio Manager and have been reporting consistently since 2013. As a result, a relatively small sample size was used which could help explain large annual fluctuations in energy performance.)"}]}}

To achieve the targets, the City of Venice has established the Extended scenario in line with what was signed in the Deadline 2020 commitments.The City analyzed three different scenarios in order to define actions and assess the 2030-2050 emissions expected:The estimate of emissions to 2030 provides for scenario 1. P&;E a reduction in emissions characterized by the effect of actions of a supra-municipal nature and regulation and of a nature typical of market evolution. The estimated trend is in any case decreasing with an expected reduction of 50% compared to 2005, 44% from 2016 and 20% from 2018 compared to the 2030 time horizon.Scenario 2. Ambitious scenario includes all the actions already examined or planned by the Municipality whose effects will have repercussions starting from 2020. In this scenario, the expected emission reduction trend is a reduction of 65% compared to 2005, 61% compared to 2016 and 44% compared to 2018 compared to the 2030 time horizon.Scenario 3. Extended scenario includes all the actions concerning possible developments that the Municipality undertakes to undertake in order to meet the savings target defined by the 2020 Deadline. In this scenario, the expected emission reduction trend is a reduction 72% compared to 2005, 69% compared to 2016 and 56% compared to 2018 compared to the 2030 time horizon.The latter is the scenario that the City of Venice will have to implement in order to meet the 2030-2050 commitments set with the signing of the 2020 Deadline."}]}}

National Grid reported natural gas use data for Brooklyn,parts of Queens, and Staten Island. The Long Island Power Author-ity (LIPA) reported electricity use data for the Rockaways area ofQueens. Fuel oil use was provided by private fuel oil suppliers, perLocal Law 43 of 2013, which requires fuel oil providers to reportfuel oil deliveries by fuel type to the City on an annual basis. TheNew York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) providedon-road transportation vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) data. Energyuse data for public transit were provided by the MetropolitanTransportation Authority (MTA) for New York City Transit (NYCT)subways and buses, Staten Island Railway (SIR), MTA Metro-NorthRail Road (MNR) and Long Island Railroad (LIRR) commuter rail,and MTA Bus Company buses; by the Port Authority of New Yorkand New Jersey (PANYNJ) for Trans-Hudson (PATH) commuter rail;and New Jersey Transit (NJT) for its commuter rail and buses.Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2Ofrom wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissionswere calculated based on the destruction of volatile material inanaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration andflow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet ofdigester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solidsdestroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the dailynitrogen load discharged by each of the City's 14 wastewatertreatment plant to the formula in the LGOP.Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gascollection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani-tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exportedsolid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi-dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste andapplying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken fromEPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from naturalgas distribution was calculated using data provided by NationalGrid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal-culated using data provided by ConEd. ."}]}}

For homes, we have a separate performance standard which applies Energy Star and OHBA Net Zero Home Labelling program, again in 4 steps, to 2030 net zero emission. The TGS is applied through the development approvals process to projects caught through our criteria for what requires approvals. However the TGS acts as a standalone sustainability framework for any member of the public to use whether or not approvals apply e.g. individual home owners, and the TGS can be applied on a voluntary basis for renovations.Link: <URL> The TGS v4 update includes a Tier 2 and Tier 3 (voluntary high performance) requirement to conduct a material emissions assessment for upfront structural and envelope components, which make up the majority of embodied carbon and align with TGS design and construction stage implementation. Tier 3 offers a whole building Life Cycle Analysis with 20% reduction below baseline building as a stretch target.

This made it possible to identify key mitigation actors and have relevant information for monitoring. The GHG inventory of Jesus Maria was prepared with information for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2020, and processed in 2021. The compiling agency was the District Municipality of Jesus Maria through the Sustainability and City Services Management considering a basic level, which included greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Also at the municipal level, a GHG Inventory has been developed. The objective of the Greenhouse Gas Inventory is to quantify the carbon footprint and water footprint of the Jesus Maria district by 2020. The carbon footprint is a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory that allows identifying the total carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emitted and the sources that generate this emission. On the other hand, the water footprint is an indicator to measure the volume of water required directly and indirectly, along the supply chain, to make a product or provide a service. In this sense, the quantification of the carbon footprint and water footprint of the District Municipality of Jesus Maria will cover the nine sectors of the district, taking into account the guidelines set out in international standards ISO 10064 (carbon footprint) and ISO 14046 (water footprint).It should be noted that the Greenhouse Gas Inventory - BASIC has not yet been completed due to the health and economic crisis in which Peru finds itself as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic."}]}}
