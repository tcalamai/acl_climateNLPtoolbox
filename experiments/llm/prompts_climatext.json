It should describe mechanisms, causes, or effects of climate change, or refer to significant climate-related topics in the correct context and over a meaningful time period. Simple mentions of environmental elements or non-specific facts about nature are insufficient unless they establish a connection to climate change.\n    \n    [0]: No - The sentence does not meet the criteria of discussing climate change. In cases of doubt, lack of context, or ambiguity, this label should be used.\n\nFormatting: Your answer should be formatted in this way to ensure consistency:\n```\nExplanation: [Provide a brief, clear explanation justifying the label chosen]\nLabel: [Insert Label]\n```\n\nExample of well-formatted answer:\n```\nExplanation: The sentence discusses the potential for increased volatility in monsoon seasons, connected to long-term climate patterns.\nLabel: 1\n```\n\nInput text: [[Insert Text Here]]\n[ENDPROMPT]",
