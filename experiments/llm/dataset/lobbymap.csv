{0: 'GOP  Sens. Newton,  Sawyer, McInnis  lambaste  Gov. Cooper’s  clean  energy  order,  call  it  “political theater” By  Lisa  Sorg  January  24,  2022  In  Environment  ,  Governor  Roy  Cooper  ,  Legislature Gov. Cooper  signed  Executive  Order  246  on  Jan.  7  at  NC  A&T  University  (Screenshot:  Governor’s  Facebook page) This  story  has  been  updated  with  a  statement  from  the  governor’s  office  and  Duke  Energy. In  an  icy  letter  to  Gov. Roy  Cooper,  three  Republican  state  senators  —  Paul  Newton,  Vickie  Sawyer  and  Tom McInnis  —  lambasted  the  latest  executive  order  on  clean  energy,  arguing  that  it  conflicts  with  legislative priorities  enshrined  in  the  most  recent  energy  law,  House  Bill  951. The  lawmakers  sent  a  letter  to  the  governor  on  Jan.  19. The  senators  posed  nine  questions regarding  carbon emissions,  affordability  and  transportation included  in  Executive  Order  246. The  letter  also  reiterates  several Republican  lawmakers’  public  stances  supporting  natural gas  and  nuclear  energy  over  renewables  as  a  way  to reduce  carbon  emissions. “As  you  know,  changes  to  North  Carolina’s  energy  future  cannot  be  achieved  through  executive  action  alone,” the  senators  wrote. “…  we  can  only  conclude  that  Executive  Order  246  is  mere  political  theatre.” In  response,  the  governor’s  office  issued  a  statement:  “It  has  been  Governor  Cooper’s  Executive  Orders  that have  sparked  administrative,  legislative  and  private sector  change  in  North  Carolina’s  emerging  clean  energy economy. We  hope  legislators  will  join  us  in  the  hard  work  of  transforming  transportation  just  as  they  join  us for  the  jobs  announcements  clean  energy  keeps  bringing.” On  Jan.  7,  Gov. Cooper  signed  EO  246. It  sets  several targets  to  mitigate  the  existential  threat  of  climate change:  reduction  of  statewide  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  at  least  50%  over  2005  levels  by  2030,  and  net- zero  carbon emissions  as  soon  as  possible,  no  later  than  2050. It  also  sets  a  goal  of  increasing  the  total  number  of  zero-emissions  vehicles  registered  in  North  Carolina  to  1.25 million  by  2030. In  addition,  the  order  says  the  state  will  “strive”  to  ensure  half  of  all  new  car  sales  would  be ZEV  sales  by  2030. The  new  goals  are  more  ambitious  than  those  in  the  governor’s  2018  order. EO  80  set  a  target  of  40% reduction  in  statewide  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  80,000  registered  ZEVs  by  2025. “While  legally enforceable”  —  a phrase  used  five times  in  the  three- page  letter  —  the executive  order “confuses  the  public and  appears  to  shift the  goalposts  by purporting  to establish  new emissions reductions  goals. Your  new  goals,  which  you  announced  without consultation  with  the  negotiators  who  worked  with  you  for many  months,”  on  HB  951,  “do  not  have  the  force  of  law,”  the  letter  reads. Since  EO  246  is  not  legally  enforceable,  it’s  unclear  why  the  three  senators  sent  the  letter. None  of  the  letter- writers  returned  emails  from  Policy  Watch  seeking  further  explanation. It’s  also  unclear  how  the  50%  reductions  goal  conflicts  with  those  established  in  HB  951,  which  Gov. Cooper signed  into  law. HB  951  requires  investor-owned  electric  utilities,  like  Duke  Energy,  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  70%  from  2005  levels  by  2030. Carbon  neutrality  must  be  achieved  by  the  utilities  2050. If  state  agencies  — themselves  Duke  customers  —  reduce  their  energy  emissions,  then  feasibly  that  could  help  Duke  reach  its benchmarks. Duke  Energy  acknowledged  an  email  from  Policy  Watch,  but  has  not  yet  responded. [Update:  4:20 p.m.  A Duke  Energy  spokesman  said  the  utility  would  not  comment  on  the  letter  or  the  governor’s response.] Update  5:12 p.m. The governor’s  office  responded  to  the  senators  late  Monday. The  letter  was  signed  by Dionne  Delli-Gatti  ,  the  state’s  Clean  Energy  Director  within  the  NC  Department  of  Environmental  Quality. It notes  that  “North  Carolina’s  transition  to  a  clean  transportation  sector  must  benefit  residents across  the state, including  those  in  rural  communities,  low-income  households  and  communities  of  color.”  The  letter  also acknowledges  that  transportation  funding  needs  modernized  in  light  of  the  growth  of  ZEVs. Some  of  the  letter  echoes  previous  debates  in  legislative  committees. The  letter  writers  asked  the  governor  if he  considers  nuclear  energy  a  viable  option  to  achieving  carbon  reduction  goals. In  House  Bill  951,  lawmakers originally  appropriated  $50  million  for  a  modular  nuclear  reactor;  that  provision  was  stripped  by  the  final  bill’s passage. Other  language  in  the  letter  was  akin  to  Sen.  Newton’s  grilling  of  Delli-Gatti, the  governor’s  original  nominee for  Secretary  of  the  Environment,  last  year. Newton  helped  tank  Delli-Gatti’s  nomination  over  her  lack  of enthusiasm  about  the  need  for  more  natural gas  pipelines. The  letter  took  a  similar  tone  to  the  Delli-Gatti  committee  hearing:  “Are  you  aware  that  a  disruption  in  the state’s  supply  of  natural gas  would  cause  real-time  immediate  disruptions  to  the  state’s  energy  grid?”  Newton, a  former  Duke  Energy  executive,  and  his  two  colleagues  wrote. The  letter  also lays  out  concerns  about  potential  shortfalls  in  gas  tax  revenue  if  zero-emissions  cars  and  trucks become  dominant. More  than  half  of  the  NC  Department  of  Transportation’s  revenue  comes  from  that  tax, which  helps  maintain  roads. “It  is  now  possible  for  an  electric  vehicle  to  cause  wear  and  tear  on  a  North  Carolina  road  without  its  operator contributing  anything  at  all  to  road  maintenance”  the  letter  reads. “If  only  operators  of  gasoline  power  vehicles are  subject  to  the  gasoline  tax, as  the  number  of  ZEVs  increases,  the  burden  for  funding  road  maintenance  will fall  on an  ever-smaller  number  of  drivers.” Other  states  have  established  additional  fees  for  plug-in  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles  in  order  to  cover  projected shortfalls,  according  to  the  National  Conference  of  State  Legislatures. North  Carolina  is  among  them. In  2013 and  2015,  state  lawmakers  assessed  an  additional  $130  fee  for  plug-in  electric  vehicles,  for  a  total  annual  fee of  $166. Traditional  fees  for  gas-battery  hybrids  and  conventional  gasoline  vehicles  are  $36. Other  states  have  contemplated  enacting  vehicle-miles  traveled  fees  or  mileage-based  user  fees,  according  to the  NCSL,  a  funding  mechanism  that  “seeks  to  more  closely  link”  the  taxes  “to  actual  use  of  the  roadways  by  a driver.” DOT  did  not  respond  to  an  email  seeking  comment. Duke  Energy  has  previously  supported  ZEVs  and  is  converting  much  of  its  company  fleet  to  those  types  of  cars and  trucks. The  senators  argue  that  the  higher  purchase  and  maintenances  costs  of  ZEVs  disproportionately  affects  low- income  households. It  is  true that  cars,  regardless  of  fuel  type  are  expensive. But  a  2021  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  study  showed  that  maintenance  costs  for  gasoline-powered  cars  are higher than  for  ZEVs  A  light-duty  battery-electric  car  costs  6.1  cents  per mile  to  maintain,  compared  to  10.1 cents  per mile  for  a  conventional  gasoline-powered  car/ Maintenance  costs  for  hybrids  and  plug-in  hybrids  are  between  9  and  9.5  cents  per  mile. A  separate  study  showed  that  for  some  ZEVs,  maintenance  costs  can  be  higher  within  the  first  year  but  are covered  by  the  vehicle’s  warranty. (In  North  Carolina,  ZEVs  are  exempt  from  emissions  inspections,  currently $16.40  a  year  in  the  22  counties  where  the  tests  are  still  required.) The  2021  price  of  new  electric  vehicles  ranges  from  $27,000  for  a  Nissan  LEAF  to  $100,000  for  deluxe  Tesla models. The  average  prices  in  2021  of  conventional  gas-powered  vehicles  was $41,000:  the  cheapest  being  a compact  ($23,000)  and  the  most  expensive,  a  high-end  luxury  car  ($105,000),  according  to  Kelley  Blue  Book  . HB  951  was  also  assailed  by  public  interest  groups  for  its  failure  to fully  address  affordability  issues  . The  final version  of  the  measure  contained  no  money  for  the  weatherization  of  older  homes,  which  are  generally  less energy-efficient  and  are  occupied  by  low-  and  moderate-income  households. The governor’s  office  had  not  returned  an  email  requesting  a  response  by  deadline.'}	('energy_transition_&_zero_carbon_technologies', 'no_position_or_mixed_position', [0])
{0: 'GREEN HYDROGEN  TASK FORCE WHITE PAPER AND   10 POINT ACTION PLAN JUNE 2022', 1: '2 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce Securing Green Hydrogen   for Germany and the EU Scaling up imports to permanently displace   demand for Russian gas Disclaimer: This paper has been developed under the oversight of Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) on behalf of the  Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce. It represents a synthesized view of contributing companies, and not the specific  views of any company or individual in the taskforce. RMI contributed to the analysis in this paper under contract  with FFI. SUMMARY •  Energy security without sacrificing sustainability:  Green hydrogen imports of 15 million tonnes per annum  (Mtpa) can close 35% of the supply gap of the EU’s target to eliminate the import of Russian fossil fuels by  2030, without undermining climate-related ambitions. •  A supply chain poised for rapid build-out:  Green hydrogen suppliers in Australia and potential off-takers in  Germany and the EU are poised to invest in rapid market buildup. •  Locking in demand for short-term offtake:  Industrial demand centers in Germany and the EU are ready to  offtake up to 5 Mtpa of green hydrogen in the short term, with a total addressable market of up to 27 Mtpa in  the long term. •  Managing investment risks:  By 2030, a €150/tCO2 carbon price will be sufficient for imported green hydrogen  to be competitive with fossil fuels, negating the need for any further subsidies. •  The required near-term market and first-mover support of €20 billion to €30 billion by 2030 will achieve more  than 10x leverage on capital deployed into industrial assets. •  No-regret actions:  Clear and timely government support is needed to signal confidence in a burgeoning green  hydrogen market and remove barriers to investment, and the EU should adopt a certification scheme based on  a clearly defined green hydrogen standard as quickly as possible. •  Once common standards and robust financial mechanisms are in place, stakeholders across the green  hydrogen value chain are ready to agree on contracts and ensure production, transport, storage, and  conversion facilities are ramped up at the scale required to meet deployment targets. •  Moving quickly and strategically to build up a green hydrogen trade will enable Germany and the EU to  capitalize on short-term opportunities across volatile global energy markets, and to safeguard energy security  while achieving critical decarbonization objectives.', 2: '3 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce ENERGY SECURITY WITHOUT SACRIFICING SUSTAINABILITY With Europe in the midst of a prolonged energy security crisis and the European Commission pushing Member  States to divest from Russian energy sources as quickly as possible, Germany has committed to ending its reliance  on fossil fuel imports. It faces the challenge of replacing 90 billion cubic metres of natural gas per year and 2.4  million barrels of oil per day in its energy system by the end of the decade. 1  If Germany can successfully and rapidly  deploy green energy sources to accelerate decarbonization and end its dependence on Russia and other politically  volatile energy exporters, it can demonstrate to other EU countries that security and sustainability advantages are  aligned in an accelerated green transition. Germany is exploring traditional substitutes for fossil fuels, but the government needs to ensure that replacing oil  and natural gas from Russia will not stall its climate ambitions. The country will shut down its remaining nuclear  plants by the end of the year, and while it has reopened several coal power plants in response to its ongoing  energy crisis, it still plans to phase out coal power by 2030. 2   Liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals that would allow  Germany to diversify its gas imports will not come on line until 2023, 3   and new LNG assets risk stranding given gas  price volatility and forecasts on rising carbon prices in the EU. A European-wide push to install heat pumps and  frontload energy efficiency measures can only bridge one-third of the gap in reducing demand for Russian gas. In German industry and heavy-duty transport, green hydrogen is one of the only sustainable replacement  options for natural gas and oil in the long term. German power and heating and cooling can be largely electrified  and supplied with renewables by 2035, 4  but in sectors still heavily reliant on fossil fuels and with limited  decarbonization options, hydrogen can play a critical role reshaping energy demand profiles. Securing a sufficient  hydrogen supply for these sectors will require a strategic balancing of resources. Germany’s ambitious plans to  electrify its power, transport, and buildings sectors and generate all its electricity with renewables by 2035 will limit  capacity that can be used to produce domestic green hydrogen through electrolysis. And it’s unlikely Germany  could procure any substantial blue hydrogen supply, with projects in the EU lagging, gas prices expected to remain  high, and policymakers beginning to question whether blue hydrogen production will be the most appropriate use  for the limited number of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) facilities coming on line. Green hydrogen imports can fill the supply gap, promoting energy security and sustainability objectives. Germany  can build on existing initiatives like H2Global to import green hydrogen and green ammonia from countries  with cheap renewable electricity, diversifying energy import dependence and freeing up renewable capacity  for domestic power production. By ensuring that green fuels can reach energy-intensive industry and transport  sectors, Germany can stop importing Russian gas while safeguarding industry competitiveness and accelerating  its decarbonization ambitions. At the same time, it can secure a new role for itself as a procurer and distributor  of green hydrogen to Central and Eastern Europe, establishing itself as a market leader as the green hydrogen  economy takes off. A SUPPLY CHAIN POISED FOR RAPID BUILD-OUT Deploying 15 million tonnes of imported green hydrogen per annum to energy-intensive sectors in Germany  and the EU is feasible within this decade, and commercial stakeholders are already paving the way for rapid  scale-up. Securing sufficient upstream supply requires investments and expansion in renewables infrastructure,  electrolyzers, and transformation facilities for preparing green hydrogen for transport. Prospective green hydrogen  suppliers in Australia are acquiring land rights and planning for large-scale buildup of renewables in regions with  ideal solar and wind energy profiles, ensuring abundant renewables capacity will start coming on line by 2024  to supply electrolysis farms. These suppliers are ready to invest in electrolyzers and ammonia transformation  facilities to kick-start the procurement of necessary materials and reserve manufacturing capacity. To trigger  these investments, suppliers need to have confidence that governments will stimulate demand through effective  support mechanisms and ensure that the required midstream infrastructure is established and accessible. Providing required electrolyzer quantities to green hydrogen producers in the short term will strain international  supply chains but is not impossible. For example, if planned electrolyzer manufacturing capacity is fully utilized  over the next eight years, 300 GW of cumulative installed base can be commissioned globally by 2030; 5  the EU’s  targeted hydrogen deployment of 20 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) can be produced with ~200 GW. 6', 3: '4 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of electrolyzers (with a strong foothold in Germany) are mobilizing  to meet the aggressive pace of required scale-up. While confident they can meet demand for 80 collective GW  of annual electrolyzer capacity by 2030, they emphasize the criticality of locking in contracts with hydrogen  producers as soon as possible so they can set manufacturing processes in motion. In particular, OEMs stress the  importance of procuring basic materials such as nickel as soon as possible, as they expect demand for minerals  and metals to rise as the clean energy economy expands. 7 Manufacturers of ammonia transformation (Haber-Bosch) facilities are equally confident they can meet demand  levels by 2030 but acknowledge that doing so will require doubling market manufacturing capacity by 2026 and  then doubling it three times more by 2030. It’s not only electrolyzer and conversion facility OEMs that need to significantly scale up their activities;  downstream subcomponent suppliers are preparing to maximize efficiencies and expand their operations as well. Processed materials providers and subcomponent manufacturers for technologies including wind turbines, solar  panels, electrolyzers, and ammonia transformation facilities will need to quickly industrialize for OEMs to meet  target deployment levels. And because value chains for these products are internationally dispersed, procuring  materials and subcomponents will need to be coordinated across multiple countries. To provide manufacturers and their subcomponent suppliers with certainty in the short term, the German  government or the EU could underwrite initial equipment orders, for example by guaranteeing that any  electrolyzers manufactured and not purchased by market players will be paid for with government funding. This  would guarantee that the manufacturing of electrolyzers will remain in Europe before being exported to production  markets, and could be justified under existing provisions supporting hydrogen development such as designated  IPCEIs (Important Projects of Common European Interest). Transporting sufficient green hydrogen supplies to the EU will also require significant expansion of export and import  infrastructure, as well as ammonia and hydrogen storage facilities, both at outbound and inbound ports. While  relevant ports across Western Australia and Northern Europe are planning to build up these facilities, their plans  would need to be accelerated to ensure green hydrogen can reach Germany with no transport bottlenecks by 2024. It will be important for EU governments to oversee the development of new import terminals, to ensure facilities are  built up to accommodate maximum hydrogen delivery and guarantee equal access across market players. LOCKING IN DEMAND FOR SHORT-TERM OFFTAKE European industries can receive imported hydrogen volumes in the near term even before technology upgrades  in harder-to-abate sectors are fully deployed. The German utility E.ON has signed a deal with Australian supplier  Fortescue Future Industries to import 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year into the EU, 8   the strongest  signal so far of demand for green fuel in Europe. In the short term, E.ON plans to supply green ammonia to coal  power plants interested in co-firing to reduce their emissions impact and to blend green hydrogen into the German  gas grid. Exhibit 1 differentiates between this firm demand for green hydrogen in Germany and potential demand  across Europe that has not yet been formally secured. Beyond power-sector applications, most short-term demand for green ammonia will come from fertilizer and  chemicals manufacturers seeking to replace increasingly expensive natural gas feedstock, that will be ready to  procure green ammonia (at competitive market prices) in 2024. To firm up short-term demand for their product,  suppliers will need to lock in contracts with European companies in these sectors as well as with advanced players  in steel manufacturing that are technically ready to integrate green ammonia and green hydrogen as soon as it’s  available (drivers of “Accessible (technology-ready) demand” as depicted in Exhibit 1). Steel manufacturing, shipping, and heavy transport will likely drive demand for green hydrogen in the long term, as  shown in Exhibit 2. But these sectors still require more widespread adoption of new technologies to accommodate  green fuels, limiting deployment potential for hydrogen before 2028 to first movers in each sector. Exhibit 1  categorizes most of the total addressable EU market for these sectors as “Additional potential demand” before  2030. But by 2030, green hydrogen applications in steel, shipping, and heavy-duty trucking could still represent  50% of EU demand (see Exhibit 2). As blending into the gas grid is likely to be phased out in the long term (post- 2030), demand in these three sectors will constitute more than 70% of the total EU market, with maintained  demand from fertilizer manufacturers and chemicals manufacturers (including methanol).', 4: '5 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce EXHIBIT 1: POTENTIAL DEMAND VS. PLANNED SUPPLY FOR GREEN AMMONIA AND GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE EU EXHIBIT 2: SECTORAL DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE EU, 2025 VS.  POST-2030 10 German industry and transport players — with a track record of spearheading hydrogen innovation in the EU —  can play a critical role in the development of a robust green hydrogen market by sending clear demand signals  for green hydrogen imports in the short term. With more advanced decarbonization strategies than many of their  European counterparts and ready access to advanced import and transport infrastructure, market players in  Germany could drive more than half of European demand for green ammonia and green hydrogen between 2024  and 2029 (see Exhibit 3); early adopters could capitalize on first-mover advantages while offering a blueprint  for other EU plants on effectively integrating green hydrogen into their operations. Once the market is better- established and industrial and transport players across Europe can easily access green hydrogen, Germany’s  share of total EU demand will decrease accordingly, normalizing to ~26%.', 5: '6 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce EXHIBIT 3: REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR GREEN HYDROGEN CAPITALIZING ON OPPORTUNITIES AND MINIMIZING RISKS Demand centers can benefit from opting for green hydrogen early; considering the volatility of European natural  gas markets, imported green hydrogen can enter EU markets at prices competitive with existing grey hydrogen  in 2024. i   Exhibit 4 shows that given current natural gas futures, forecasts on EU carbon costs, and forecasts on  renewables and electrolyzer prices, imported green hydrogen could be cheaper than domestically produced grey  or blue hydrogen through to 2030. EXHIBIT 4: COST PROJECTIONS FOR BLUE AND GREEN HYDROGEN (INCLUDING CARBON, STORAGE, AND TRANSPORT  COSTS) 11,12 A tight natural gas supply has inflated prices to all-time highs, and five-year futures are indicating a slow rebound,  rendering grey and blue hydrogen (produced with natural gas) uncompetitive with green in the short term. Transport cost and shipping hydrogen as ammonia impact slightly on the delivered cost of hydrogen, and in any  case do not exceed the production cost advantages of locations with optimal renewable power. So green hydrogen  imports will be comparable in cost to EU-produced green hydrogen (within a margin of error) from the time it  comes online through beyond 2030. And in the long term, importing green hydrogen can enable the EU to reserve  its limited renewables capacity for meeting direct electricity demand without stalling the deployment of green  fuels in industry and transport. i  In its recent report on Regaining Europe’s Energy Sovereignty, Agora Energiewende argues, “Considering the current objective of reducing Europe’s  dependence on (Russian) fossil gas, fossil gas-based hydrogen can no longer be considered part of the solution […] Prevailing gas prices have also  decidedly undermined the business case for blue hydrogen while significantly enhancing the competitiveness of green hydrogen.”', 6: '7 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce Reaching the economies of scale needed to drive down green hydrogen costs will not come without challenges. Infrastructure still needs to be built up to connect import and export markets, and access needs to be ensured. Manufacturers need to secure access to critical materials (like nickel) without creating price spikes in commodity  markets. Both producers and consumers of green hydrogen need to ensure that the product they secure in the  short term will be viable in the long term, both in terms of meeting certification requirements (which have yet to be  set) and maintaining cost competitiveness. The market is waiting for first movers willing to take on these challenges to invest in infrastructure and technology  buildup and mobilize the green hydrogen supply chain. But first movers risk locking in assets at price points that  might quickly render them uncompetitive. Germany and Australia — well-established leaders in supporting green hydrogen innovation — are well positioned  to take the first critical steps in establishing an internationally traded green hydrogen market, building on long- standing political and business relationships. As a well-established member of the OECD, Australia has proven  itself a highly stable and reliable trading partner of Germany and the EU. Leading industrials in both Australia and  Germany have the required expertise and capabilities to build out the green hydrogen supply chain at the rapid  pace required to displace Russian natural gas in Germany. Given that German companies collectively represent  ~20% of the global electrolyzer manufacturing market, and oversee more than 15% of global plant engineering  operations, 13  they stand to gain from the rapid buildup of a global hydrogen market. MANAGING INVESTMENT RISKS Accelerating the deployment of green hydrogen imports in Germany will come with two major investment risks: (1)  the market risk associated with expected price gaps between landed green hydrogen and conventional fuels, and  (2) the first-mover risk incurred by early participants in a green hydrogen trade that commit to prices that will prove  uncompetitive as cost comes down. MARKET RISK While green hydrogen is currently competitive with grey and blue hydrogen produced with natural gas (as shown in  Exhibit 4 above), green hydrogen fuel is still more expensive in direct competition with fuels like natural gas, crude  oil, and coal, which it will displace across several sectors. The cost gap between deploying traditional fuels to meet  industrial and transport demand versus deploying green hydrogen will depend on price evolution and the potential  renormalization of fossil fuel prices, and on rising EU carbon prices. Given Europe’s ongoing energy crisis, current  coal, crude oil, and natural gas futures indicate that fuel prices will remain above average at least until 2026 before  renormalizing to average levels. At the same time, the EU ETS price is projected to rise from €80/tonne (2022  average) up to €140/tonne by 2030. Pricing trends that will determine market risk level for green hydrogen are  depicted in Exhibit 5. EXHIBIT 5: NATURAL GAS PRICE OUTLOOK VS. CARBON PRICE OUTLOOK FOR THE EU, 2024–2030 14', 7: '8 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce Rapid scale-up would benefit from current high energy prices, but still, approximately €10 billion ii  would be needed  to offset market risk against direct competing fuels — like natural gas, crude oil, and coal — and land 15 Mtpa (500  TWh) of green hydrogen imports in Germany by 2030 (see Exhibit 6). If energy prices return to average levels by  2024 (counter to natural gas, oil, and coal futures), market risk could grow to up to €36 billion. EXHIBIT 6: TOTAL COST OF PROCURING GREEN HYDROGEN VS. STANDARD FUELS TO MEET 500 TWH OF ENERGY  DEMAND BY 2030 15,16 This additional investment would be distributed over the next eight years, catalyzing the development of a self- propelled, competitive energy supply vector (see Exhibit 7). Between 2025 and 2027 (assuming energy prices  remain high, as expected 17 ), an average additional investment of about €1 billion to €2 billion per year would offset  green hydrogen’s premium against standard fuels. As hydrogen supply ramps up, an additional €4 billion in 2028  and €2 billion in 2029 could land 10 Mtpa in Germany before 2030. In 2030, with a carbon price at $150/tonne,  landing 15 Mtpa of green hydrogen in Germany will be market-competitive without additional support mechanisms  beyond the EU-ETS. EXHIBIT 7: DISTRIBUTED COST OF PROCURING GREEN HYDROGEN VS. STANDARD FUELS TO MEET 500 TWH OF  ENERGY DEMAND BY 2030 18,19 Exhibit 7 indicates how the market gap might widen if fuel prices renormalize to historical average values faster. Given the wide range of market risk exposure, a contract-for-difference support mechanism linked to fossil fuel  prices could effectively mitigate market risk for green hydrogen imports without oversubsidization. Exhibit 8 shows how cumulative market risk grows as assets are scaled up to deliver higher volumes of green  hydrogen to the EU, until falling production costs render green hydrogen competitive with standard fossil fuels and  market risk is fully eliminated. Even if alternative fuel prices renormalize to pre-crisis levels and remain lower than  expected between 2025 and 2030, Exhibit 8 shows that market risk will still shrink as carbon prices rise and will be  eliminated soon after 2030. ii  €10 billion would be needed in additional investment, compared to business-as-usual procurement of standard fuels under projected energy prices.', 8: '9 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce EXHIBIT 8: CUMULATIVE MARKET RISK FOR GREEN HYDROGEN ASSETS UNDER FORECASTED VS. RENORMALIZED  ENERGY PRICES FIRST-MOVER RISK Beyond market risk, first-mover risk for early assets will depend on the rate at which costs fall for green hydrogen. Costs of production and transport are expected to compress as the market matures and economies of scale are  reached. Based on well-established cost curves for renewable energy sources and electrolyzers, production  costs for green hydrogen in Australia are expected to fall from €2.1/kg in 2024 to €1.5/kg in 2030, at which point  exporters aim to have installed more than 150 GW of electrolyzer capacity. Accounting for transport, storage, and  conversion costs, the total cost of landing green hydrogen in the EU is expected to fall from €3.8/kg in 2024 to  €2.5/kg in 2030. 20 So prospective suppliers and consumers of green hydrogen in the short term risk locking themselves in to contract  prices that will exceed market prices for green hydrogen in the long term. If green hydrogen can be delivered  to the EU at or below €2.5/kg after 2030, assets built up before 2030 to deliver hydrogen at higher costs risk  stranding. As an indicative example, assets built in 2026 will be locked in at set costs for producing and distributing  green hydrogen; as these costs fall for new assets built up after 2026, the first-mover risk for these assets will  persist. Exhibit 9 illustrates how first-mover risk for assets built up in 2026 iii   will grow before 2030 as competing  technology costs continue to fall, before reaching a maximum value of €0.5 billion/year once hydrogen market  costs levelize. Offsetting first-mover risk for this asset class before 2030 would require €1.3 billion in total, and  offsetting first-mover risk for its 20-year lifetime would require €8.4 billion total. EXHIBIT 9: INDICATIVE BUILD-UP OF FIRST-MOVER RISK OVER THE LIFETIME OF AN EARLY ASSET CLASS 21 iii  This example calculation assumes ~7 GW of electrolyzer capacity will be built up in 2026 to deliver an additional ~0.7 Mtpa of green hydrogen to the EU in  that year.', 9: '10 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce Exhibit 10 illustrates how collective first-mover risk – i.e., the required level of investment to keep all existing  production capacity competitive with falling market prices – could build up as suppliers invest in the scale of  assets required to deliver targeted levels (15 Mtpa) of green hydrogen to Germany between 2024 and 2030. Risk  accrues as capacity is built up at costs higher than the expected post-2030 market price for green hydrogen. First-mover risk can be reduced by building up most capacity in later years when costs are lower, but for costs to  fall at projected rates, it’s important that sufficient capacity is built up early to achieve learning curves and scaling  benefits. Most of the capacity required to deliver 15 Mtpa by 2030 will come on line between 2028 and 2030,  minimizing first-mover risk, but achieving desired cost reduction rates will require building up capacity that can  deliver ~3 Mtpa by the end of 2027. EXHIBIT 10: MAXIMUM FIRST-MOVER RISK OF LANDING 15 MTPA OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN GERMANY BY 2030 AND UP  TO 20 MTPA OF GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE EU POST-2030 22 Ultimately, first-mover risk will be eliminated as the green hydrogen market matures. Exhibit 11 illustrates in further  detail how maximum first-mover risk for each new class of assets will evolve until first-mover risk is mitigated for  the 2030 asset class, when hydrogen market prices will reflect blended costs of the portfolio of production assets  on line. Early assets will incur high maximum yearly first-mover risk as they will be built at the highest costs. The  maximum first-mover risk for assets coming on line in 2027 and 2028 will be driven by higher volumes rather than  costs. And by 2029, maximum first-mover risk will decline even as higher volumes come on line due to falling costs. EXHIBIT 11: MAXIMUM YEARLY FIRST-MOVER RISK PER ASSET CLASS BUILT EACH YEAR BETWEEN 2024 AND 2030 But first-mover risk will not reach maximum levels until market costs stabilize; before 2030, while costs are still  falling year-on-year, the total first-mover risk for all assets coming on line could be offset by ~€8.9 billion (see  Exhibit 12). After 2030, to maintain the scale of assets required to deliver 15 million tonnes of hydrogen per year  to Germany, a maximum sum of ~€3.7 billion/year would be required to offset first-mover risk. This risk would  represent less than 10% of the total annual cost of delivering the same supply of green hydrogen after 2030.', 10: '11 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce EXHIBIT 12: PRE-2030 CUMULATIVE FIRST-MOVER RISK AND POST-2030 YEARLY FIRST-MOVER RISK OF DELIVERING   15 MTPA TO GERMANY 23 Risk-sharing mechanisms can be developed to mitigate first-mover risk and remove barriers to the early  investments required to kick-start green hydrogen trade between Australian suppliers and German consumers. Combining public subsidies incentivizing demand sectors to invest in early deliveries of green hydrogen with  private-sector risk management could effectively defray first-mover risk. Public investments to offset market and first-mover risk will directly benefit German and European industry. Estimates indicate that building up the assets necessary to achieve 15 Mtpa of hydrogen deployment in Europe  by 2030 will require between €200 billion and €300 billion of investment, with most spending concentrated on  new renewables and electrolyzers. 24  Installing 150 GW of electrolyzers could cost between €70 billion and €90  billion, iv  depending on how technology costs evolve. Building the level of renewables necessary to power these  electrolyzers could cost between €100 billion and €150 billion, v  depending on the portfolio of sources selected (i.e.,  a combination of solar panels and onshore and offshore wind turbines). And new enabling infrastructure could cost  between €20 billion and €50 billion, depending on evolving costs of conversion and storage facilities as well as  transportation technologies. 25 Early spending on kick-starting green hydrogen production supply chains could direct a substantial portion of  these investments toward German and European renewables manufacturers and electrolyzer suppliers. Spending  on storage, conversion, and distribution assets could direct additional investments toward German and European  engineering, manufacturing, and construction companies. Investing €20 billion to €30 billion between now and  2030 on economic support to offset market risk (€10 billion to €20 billion) and first-mover risk (€8 billion to €10  billion) would unlock up to 10x more capital expenditure for industrial development, a market that Germany and the  EU are well positioned to supply goods and services into. iv  This estimate assumes the cost for electrolyzers between 2025 and 2030 averages between US$200-300/kW, with additional balance of plant costs. v  This estimate assumes the cost for new solar panels averages US$700/kW between 2025 and 2030, cost for new onshore wind averages $US1,300/kW,  and cost for new offshore wind averages $US1,500/kW.', 11: '12 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce NO-REGRET ACTIONS Several critical actions can be taken by the end of 2022 to successfully develop a robust import supply chain in  time for green hydrogen to reach the continent by 2024. Policymakers in Germany and the EU can design and  implement mechanisms that will solidify long-term demand for green hydrogen imports: •  Set precise standards for “green hydrogen” and adopt a clear certification scheme as quickly as possible to  provide prospective suppliers and consumers enough guidance to draft long-term procurement contracts. Germany and Australia can lay the groundwork for production-side certification, to ensure that shipped  hydrogen will be compliant with new EU regulations set in recent Delegated Acts linked to REPowerEU. •  Design effective support mechanisms (potentially including public procurement mechanisms and targeted  subsidy schemes, such as H2Global) to signal confidence in a burgeoning green hydrogen market and remove  barriers to investment by mitigating long-term market and first-mover risks. •  Engage with companies to develop and deploy an overarching communication strategy that could build up  public support for green ammonia and green hydrogen. •  Continue to fund innovation in advanced hydrogen technologies and applications, especially in the transport  sector. The EU’s adoption of a green hydrogen standard and certification scheme will be critical for mobilizing investments  and providing adequate guidance to green hydrogen end-users. Once clear standards and support mechanisms  are in place, stakeholders across the green hydrogen value chain can draft and agree on procurement contracts  to ensure production, transport, storage, and conversion facilities can be ramped up at the scale required to meet  deployment targets. Contracts will allow OEMs to reserve necessary manufacturing capacity and purchase scarcer  raw materials, and will mobilize processed materials and subcomponent suppliers along clean technology value  chains to swiftly industrialize. Ports and potential distributors of green hydrogen in Europe should invest in infrastructure that will enable product  distribution from entry points to industrial clusters in Germany. In Europe, the Ports of Rotterdam, Amsterdam,  Antwerp, Zeebrugge, Hamburg/Stade, Wilhelmshaven, Brunsbüttel, and potentially Gioia Tauro should engage  in planning for the buildup of hydrogen reception and distribution infrastructure as prospective importers. Governments can accelerate permitting for these crucial infrastructure projects and oversee operations to ensure  fair and open access to facilities. Overall, policymakers in Germany and the EU must act as critical enablers, continuously supporting market  players in their plans to establish a first-of-its-kind green hydrogen trade corridor between Europe and Australia  and providing a blueprint for other international collaborations. By setting clear market standards and product  specifications, leveraging targeted subsidy schemes to mitigate risk, and overseeing proper access to import and  distribution infrastructure, policymakers will not only accelerate the deployment of green hydrogen in Germany,  but also lay the groundwork for a harmonized green hydrogen market across Europe.', 12: '13 Analysis developed by RMI, with support and input from the Green Hydrogen Crisis Taskforce 1.

{0: '2 Global Energy Transition Readiness Index Foreword    by Torsten Henzelmann Global Head of Energy and Utilities, Roland Berger    A key dimension to tackling   the trilemma is speed in co- operating on a global level. We see  where we currently stand on cutting  emissions and how little time we  have left to act if we are to stick to  the target of limiting global warming  to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial  levels. When thinking about  collaboration efforts and complex  global solutions, we should consider  which form of cooperation is the  fastest and is best suited for future  technologies. This creates something  of a paradox: Cooperation that  involves all partners globally will inevitably be slower than individual  efforts. Different countries have  different degrees of industrialization  and globalization, different  standards of living and,consequently,  different interests. Against this  background, it is hardly surprising  that different regions view climate  neutrality differently. Rather than  coordinated pan-global efforts, a  more effective approach would likely  be cooperation between like-minded  countries. These clusters of  countries, by working together, can  set a course that others can then  follow.» Foreword    by Christian Bruch President and CEO, Siemens Energy    We have less than a decade to  stop the irreversible effects on our planet. An immediate, over- whelming and coordinated global  effort to stave off the worst impacts  of climate change is needed – in all  regions of the world and throughout  all sectors. There is no one-size-fits- all solution. Each country has  different challenges and target positions, so it needs specific  answers to drive the energy  transition. And this is where the  Global Energy Readiness Index  comes into play. Based on more  than 2,000 expert interviews, it  demonstrates where the energy  transition currently stands – an  important compass for the year  2023.»'}	('alignment_with_ipcc_on_climate_action', 'strongly_supporting', [0])
"{0: ""Imperial Oil 2022 Investor Day    Thursday March 10 th , 2022 energy demand is quite robust now and is very nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels. This is despite  the challenges that new variants pose as society has become more and more resilient. This has added up  to a fairly steady decline in global inventories, which are currently tracking below the 5-year average  with no signs of improving. For Imperial, our low corporate cash breakeven in the mid-20s on a U.S. dollar basis allows us to be  profitable even at low prices. But certainly, at today's prices, we can generate a lot of cash and grow our  returns to shareholders. The priority we have been putting on our existing assets has put us in an  enviable position to take advantage of both the demand recovery and the strong commodity price  environment. We saw this in 2021, and we expect it to continue as we go forward this year. As we look to the future,  demand for energy in all forms will continue to grow. The world's population is expected to continue to  grow through 2050. And with this growth comes the need for more energy. In addition, while in the  developed world, we are seeing technology help improve energy efficiency. In other parts of the world, the pursuit of improved standards of living is driving increased per capita  energy usage. And as the global energy supply evolves to meet this increasing demand, we expect to see  growth in natural gas as well as other lower emission energy sources. These trends are expected to vary  by sector. Liquids fuel demand is driven primarily by transportation and chemicals, both of which are  expected to grow. Commercial transportation is driven by economic activity, and we see personal vehicle ownership  growing as standards of living continue to improve. And as standards of living improve, the demand for  air travel is also expected to rise. With respect to chemicals, demand is driven by consumer preferences. Chemicals form the basis for so many products we all use today. You might immediately think of plastics,  but don't forget about textiles, cosmetics, fertilizers and many more products that we all rely on every  day. As demand for energy grows, we also expect to see a shift to lower carbon fuels as the world works  towards achieving the goals of the Paris Accord. Natural gas is expected to grow significantly as our  renewables and nuclear. And though we expect to see growth in overall demand, that growth should be  tempered somewhat by advances in technologies that drive energy efficiency. Clearly, there are many possible scenarios around the future energy mix, but one thing sure seems  certain, they all continue to require oil and gas to a large extent. And to ensure there are sufficient  supplies of oil and gas, significant future investment is required. And while there is a lot of uncertainty  around the transition timing and how it may take place, we need to remain flexible to respond,  regardless of how it plays out.

Telstra chief Vicki Brady said: “Domestic gas prices need to be considered as part of an agreed and co-ordinated national approach to energy more broadly. “Capping gas prices is unlikely to be effective unless it is part of a national strategy to address demand and supply issues, including the promotion of electriﬁcation and clean alternatives.” Seven Group chief executive Ryan Stokes, who oversees a conglomerate spanning building products, mining services, media and energy, said gas supply remained the real issue for the economy, and gas price caps were likely to be counterproductive. “As both a major gas supplier, and a decent sized user, we can see both sides of the issue,” Mr Stokes said. “The issue is supply is out of balance with demand – we need to encourage supply.” Expansion plans reconsidered On Friday, Queensland gas pioneer Richard Cottee joined Santos chief Kevin Gallagher’s criticism of the policy as “Soviet-style” when he conﬁrmed expansion plans of two junior gas developers were being reconsidered after this week’s legislation. He said the government would need to underwrite future projects to ensure they went ahead. “If the bureaucrats think they know far more than market forces, then the command economy will have to step in to compensate,” Mr Cottee told  AFR Weekend. Rob Scott, chief executive of Wesfarmers, similarly urged a long-term view, and backed gas reservation for domestic users over price caps. “Any government intervention into markets needs to be viewed with caution to avoid unintended consequences,” he said. “The lesson for Australia is that energy policy and transition should be considered from a multi-decade perspective, given the horizon for investment is long term, as is the process of energy transition.', 2: '19/12/2022, 10:09 Energy bill: Top CEOs Vicki Brady, Ryan Stokes, Rob Scott, Meg O’Neill, Mike Henry warn gas price caps won’t solve suppl… https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/australia-s-top-ceos-warn-gas-price-caps-won-t-solve-supply-crisis-20221216-p5c6z0 3/6 “The domestic gas reservation policy in WA was established many years ago, at a time when new gas reserves were coming onto the market, so everyone could adjust to the new regime and make investments on the basis of this clarity. This has proven to be very successful.” Graincorp chief Robert Spurway backed calls for reservation, and Mark Fitzgibbon, boss of health insurer NIB, was typically blunt. “Nothing good ever comes out of government price intervention in competitive markets. It would be better and more efﬁcient to subsidise those in need,” Mr Fitzgibbon said. The passage on Thursday of legislation enshrining a one-year, $12-per-gigajoule price cap on uncontracted gas, and a permanent code of conduct to enforce the sale of gas at a “reasonable price”, has infuriated gas producers. Santos’ Mr Gallagher said the “Soviet-style” price controls could require the government to underwrite new gas projects that may not otherwise proceed under the policy. [https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5c6ke] Investing ‘a riskier prospect’ Woodside Energy chief executive Meg O’Neill backed the view that investment would be under threat. “A price cap would make investing in Australia a riskier prospect than other jurisdictions, undermining conﬁdence in ﬁscal stability and leading to under- investment in supply,” she said. “For example, we are considering future development opportunities in the Bass Strait as well as investment in gas capacity mechanisms that can alleviate pressure, such as ﬂoating storage and regasiﬁcation units. These investments will be less attractive if pricing is limited.” Origin Energy chief executive Frank Calabria also urged a more targeted response. “We believe the best way to put downwards pressure on gas prices is to take immediate steps to encourage investment in new sources of supply near southern markets where traditional gas ﬁelds are in decline and most gas demand exists,” Mr Calabria said.', 3: '19/12/2022, 10:09 Energy bill: Top CEOs Vicki Brady, Ryan Stokes, Rob Scott, Meg O’Neill, Mike Henry warn gas price caps won’t solve suppl… https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/australia-s-top-ceos-warn-gas-price-caps-won-t-solve-supply-crisis-20221216-p5c6z0 4/6 “Actions that seek to artiﬁcially hold prices at a certain level are more likely to discourage investment and cause other challenges for the market down the track.” But Jeanne Johns, chief executive of explosives and fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot, which is a large gas user  [https://www.afr.com/link/follow- 20180101-p5byfu] , said government intervention was long overdue. “Natural gas is inherently a local/regional market, which can get connected with investment in LNG facilities, which requires regulation controlling export rights and support for the domestic users and economy,” she said. “For instance, the disruption in the Europe gas market is rapidly de-industrialising Europe. As a country with high energy prices, we risk hollowing out Australian manufacturing and exporting our jobs to countries with affordable energy. “Like many Australian domestic manufacturers on the east coast, we want to secure skilled jobs, invest in technology and maintain security of supply for agricultural and mining sectors.” Slowing economy On the broader economic outlook, chief executives were generally upbeat. National Australia Bank boss Ross McEwan was among the many chief executives who said Australia was entering a slowdown in a much stronger position than many global peers. But the rising interest rates and cost-of-living pressures will hit Australian households next year, and many bosses expect the impacts will be felt unevenly across different sectors. Commonwealth Bank chief Matt Comyn said: “The economy will continue to slow in 2023, as the impact of already announced increases in the cash rate continue to ﬂow through. Incitec Pivot CEO Jeanne Johns.

We are monitoring a range of indicators, including spend patterns, sentiment, savings buffers, employment, wages and stress in our portfolio, to provide a picture of the aggregate and localised performance of the economy.” Still, some bosses are bracing for a tough year. Darren Steinberg, chief executive of property investor Dexus, warned: “Australia’s economic situation will get worse before it gets better, and [we] are focused on reducing gearing and positioning ourselves for a difﬁcult 2023.” Mr Stokes urged Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe to reconsider further rate rises. “We are concerned the RBA has a greater inﬂuence over the economy than they should. The current rate hikes are too aggressive and potentially damaging,” he said. “To pivot from a record period of stimulating expansion with ﬁscal and monetary policy to a fast contraction is not a considered policy but a reaction. “Interest rate changes have a lag effect that will bite. The full impact of this, coupled with the increased costs of domestic energy, should be assessed before more aggressive rate increases are made.” BHP chief executive Mike Henry also sees headwinds ahead, and is concerned government policy could exacerbate them. “We risk holding ourselves back if we do not address globally uncompetitive ﬁscal settings, falling productivity and education levels, and rising inﬂation and skills shortages,” he said. “At the national level, the primacy of enterprise bargaining should be protected and mining excluded from multi-employer bargaining, while in Queensland the unplanned royalty increase should be repealed. “Australia’s best shot at long-term economic success is to pursue an aggressive growth agenda built on a more diversiﬁed economy.

Mr Scott said: “I see industrial relations as an emerging risk in 2023 for the Australian economy, with multi-employer bargaining reforms being implemented, adding complexity to labour markets, at the same time the economy is slowing down. “There are other IR reforms that should be prioritised that will support wage growth, participation and productivity such as award simpliﬁcation, but these don’t seem to be priorities.” –  With Colin Packham James Thomson  is a Chanticleer columnist based in Melbourne.

{0: '800-B Beaty St.  Davidson, NC  28036  Tel (980) 228-1532  Nanette.Lockwood@TraneTechnologies.com   September 12, 2022    Ms. Holly Tapani  Stratospheric Protection Division   Office of Atmospheric Programs  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington, DC 20460    Submitted to Federal eRulemaking Portal:  http://www.regulations.gov     Re: Docket EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0836 Protection of Stratospheric Ozone: Listing of Substitutes  Under the Significant New Alternatives Policy Program in Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, and Fire  Suppression- Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for SNAP 25    Dear Holly:     We appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments to the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) as it considers additional refrigerant listings under SNAP 25. Trane Technologies (Trane) is a climate company with well-known brands such as Trane and Thermo  King, which are global leaders in stationary and transport air conditioning and transport  refrigeration products. Trane Technologies is well known for its global leadership in transitioning  away from today’s high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. Trane began transitioning its  global high-performance chiller portfolio in 2015 and Thermo King began transitioning its EU  transport refrigeration products in 2014, long before regulations began taking shape. Trane  committed to reduce our customer’s emissions by one gigaton (1 billion metric tons) of CO 2 e  between 2020 and 2030. Transitioning away from high GWP HFCs with highly efficient products  will help us meet this goal. We strongly support the direction of the SNAP 25 proposal and are encouraged that EPA continues  to approve next generation, lower GWP refrigerants to facilitate the transition away from high GWP  HFCs, especially in chillers due to the January 2024 transition date already set by twelve states. Trane Technologies is a member of the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute and  the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy and supports those comments with further  clarifications as described below.', 1: 'Trane Technologies Comments to EPA–HQ–OAR–2021–0836 (SNAP 25) September 12, 2022 Page 2   A2L Refrigerant Approvals for Chillers Should be Linked to the Latest Available Design Standards  to Facilitate the 2024 Transition in Twelve States . We support the linking of industry design and use standards to the transition to lower flammable  (“A2L”) refrigerants. However, there should be an expedited process for updating the linked  standards, to ensure ease of compliance and the availability of the latest technologies. As an  alternative, we suggest linking the approvals only to the related standards provisions, in this case,  that would mean only linking to the flammable refrigerant provisions of UL 60335-2-40. This is important, because there are some shortcomings in non-refrigerant related provisions of  the UL 60335-2-40 Edition 3 for chillers. Specifically, the provisions do not meet current National  Electrical Code requirements for leakage current and electric strength and important national  safety standards are omitted, which prevents the use of some key components. Most importantly, the testing laboratories will only certify to the latest published standards,  making certification to UL 60335-2-40 Edition 3 unavailable following the publication of Edition 4,  which is expected in October 2022. This would make compliance with SNAP 25 impossible as we  prepare to commercialize in 2023 for the 2024 transition deadline in the twelve states. If updated standards cannot be incorporated on an expedited basis and the approvals cannot be  linked only to the relevant language within the standard, then we suggest delaying the approval  of SNAP 25 as it relates to chillers until EPA can link the approval to UL 60335-3-40 Edition 4. SNAP Listing Decisions for Certain Very Short-Lived Substances Should be Based on the Latest  Science. SNAP listed refrigerants are recognized and followed around the world. Consequently, decisions  should always incorporate the latest science. Short-lived substances have unique properties that  diminish the ability of substances with calculable but not measurable ODP to actually impact the  ozone layer. As we move toward the lowest feasible GWP, it is important to maximize the  availability of practical alternatives. Please contact me directly to discuss further.

Our sector has already  been forced to make unprecedented curtailments in the last 12 months. We are deeply concerned that the winter ahead  could deliver a decisive blow to many of our operations, and we call on EU and Member State leaders to take emergency  action to preserve their strategic electricity-intensive industries and prevent permanent job losses. 50% of the EU’s aluminium and zinc capacity has already been forced offline due to the power crisis, as well as  significant curtailments in silicon and ferroalloys production and further impacts felt across copper and nickel sectors. In  the last month, several companies have had to announce indefinite closures and many more are on the brink ahead of  a life-or-death winter for many operations. Producers face electricity and gas costs over ten times higher than last year,  far exceeding the sales price for their products. We know from experience that once a plant is closed it very often  becomes a permanent situation, as re-opening implies significant uncertainty and cost. Europe’s clean energy goals require a competitive and growing metals sector to ensure a secure supply of the extra raw  materials needed to shift away from fossil fuels. Base metals, battery metals, and other metals are all needed in higher  volumes for Europe’s grid infrastructure, electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolysers, as  well as a complex web of other essential value chains across the European economy. We actively support your drive to  improve Europe’s strategic autonomy for its energy transition, and we want to make the long-term investments needed  into advancing and expanding our operations ready for 2050. But all metals production needs affordable and available electricity and gas, whether aluminium and zinc today or lithium  and cobalt tomorrow. We are deeply concerned that Europe faces a critical situation for the foreseeable future, with a  perfect storm of sky-high electricity prices, no energy market liquidity due to insecure gas supplies, a continued nuclear  and coal-phase out, and the remaining power sources being insufficient to cover market needs. Europe cannot have a successful energy and raw materials strategy if its power and gas prices stay at today’s levels for  a sustained period without relief. The long-term investment climate for all EU strategic metals operations and projects  risks being decimated, and more closures will follow next year once companies are not protected by their 2022 hedging  of the electricity price. Any further EU production loss will also increase global greenhouse gas emissions, due to  replacement supply from more polluting regions 1 . 1  Many metals are now imported from China and elsewhere. Chinese production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European  zinc production; 3 more in the case of aluminium and 3,8 more for silicon. We estimate that Europe’s replacement imports of aluminium  have already added 6-12 million tonnes of CO2 this year. September 2022', 1: 'We call on European and national leaders to look at all available options for safeguarding our companies and their  future. The crisis requires a complete package of solutions, and no option should be left off the table in this  unprecedented situation. Our urgent requests (further detailed in the Annex) are that the EU should: •   Take temporary action to address the excessive price of fossil fuel power generators , with an aim to  reduce the price of power offered to the market while not contributing to further shortages through increased  consumption. It is important that any mechanism does not reduce or remove incentives to enter into long  term power purchase agreements for energy intensive industry. Electricity sold over long-term power  purchase agreements must be exempted from revenue cap measures. •   Improve the temporary state aid framework , through raising the EUR 50 million threshold for relief  Member States can provide to struggling companies, adding support for companies temporarily reducing  or curtailing production (i.e. for short-term lay-off-costs), and making other crucial technical fixes. •   Actively promote and incentivize the use of renewable power purchase agreements , through  immediate regulatory action to improve conditions for industrial consumers, and a massively accelerated  roll-out of renewables generation. •   Minimise the impact of extra carbon costs from the Emissions Trading System , through: o   Issuing EU guidance to Member States requesting they provide the full allowed compensation of  indirect carbon costs (limiting the indirect costs to 1.5% of gross value added) o   Using the Market Stability Reserve to address excessive carbon prices which are adding extra  pressure onto the electricity price •   Provide further support to companies  through capping taxes and surcharges on electricity and gas,  creating an emergency EU relief fund for energy intensive industries. •   Implement schemes supporting short term interruptibility and demand response  flexibility and  critically provide support for longer term care and maintenance curtailments to increase the chance of  survival of impacted operations. More widely, it’s important that the European Commission avoids extra regulatory costs on suffering industries in this  critical period, diversifies sources of gas supply and evaluates options for temporary solidarity measures to rebalance  the windfall profits in other specific sectors during this crisis. The upcoming discussions on the electricity market and  long term energy supply are important to the European non-ferrous metals industry and we intend to play an active  role. We appeal for you to take swift and comprehensive action to address today’s crisis situation, in Friday’s emergency  summit and beyond. We would be pleased to discuss our concerns and recommendations further in a meeting with  you.

Sergio Zappa President and CEO, Normalien SpA Howard Winbow Director European Affairs', 5: 'Annex 1: Full list of measures addressing high energy prices We propose the following concrete solutions that go beyond energy market as this unfolding crisis requires a coordinated,  largescale policy response which matches the severity of today’s situation, that should put all policy options on the table. Structural reform of the energy market organization should be thoroughly analysed and hasty decisions should be avoided. -   Short term: o   Measures addressing the cost of fossil fuel power generators, aiming to reduce the price of power  offered to the market. Such measures would however need to be very carefully designed and  implemented as to not lead to increased consumption, particularly from storage facilities, and further  shortages of gas volumes, thus endangering security of supply and exacerbating the problem they seek to  tackle. o   Promote RES power purchase agreements (PPAs) through targeted schemes and immediate  regulatory intervention : ▪   Accelerate building of new RES generation to quickly make available larger amounts of electricity  in the market and PPA volumes for industry. ▪   Increase liquidity for PPAs by incentivizing existing and new generators to offer electricity for this  purpose (e.g. through tax incentives, reduced interest rates, green bonds, investment aid  conditional on signing PPAs in case of new generation capacity). ▪   Incentivise RES plants participating in auctions for state-backed PPAs to contract at least 50% of  the installed capacity/output through long-term corporate PPAs. ▪   State/EU guarantees to foster signing of RES PPAs with electro-intensive industry, as the Nordic  scheme or the Spanish FERGEI system. ▪   Addressing firming and shaping costs of RES PPAs, through schemes like the Green Pool; explore  the possibility of an EU-wide Green Pool-style solution that could help mitigate the impact of gas  on respective power prices. o   Reduced or capped taxes and surcharges  on electricity and gas for the energy intensive industries. o   Swiftly improve the temporary emergency state aid framework  as to provide useful and sufficient  conditions that actually help the most energy-intensive industry during this high energy prices crisis. The  eligibility period should be calculated based on the increase in costs since Q42020 and the eligibility  requirement to show a negative EBITDA should be removed as it does not reflect the financial reality -a  company’s EBITDA can be positive while making a net loss. The framework should clarify what can be  considered as an undertaking and the cap for maximum aid for energy-intensive consumers (50 million  EUR) should be significantly increased. Also, for decarbonization aid to ETS sectors, it should be clarified  that conditionality requirements based on ETS benchmarks should only be applicable in case where there  is a defined product benchmark (not for sectors under the heat and fuel fallback approach). o   Issue EU guidance to Member States encouraging full compensation  (indirect costs limited to 1.5%  of GVA) of indirect emissions costs of the EU ETS in all Member States. o   Create an emergency EU fund  that would offer urgent relief/mitigate soaring energy prices impact on  competitiveness of European energy-intensive industry. o   Ensure EU ETS prices 2  do not contribute  to the pressure on the electricity and gas price – use the  Market Stability Reserve to address excessive prices. o   Implement schemes supporting  interruptibility and demand response flexibility . 2  ETS prices do have an impact on electricity prices: a gas power plant emits around 0.4 tCO2/MWh, so when it sets the electricity price on the market, the CO2 pass-through cost is around 36 EUR/MWh (considering an ETS price of 90 EUR). It may not seem much in the context of present wholesale market prices, but the comparison should be made against the “normal” electricity prices before the crisis (40-60 EUR/MWh), thus reflecting accurately the impact of ETS prices.', 6: 'o   Temporary solidarity measures  addressing the windfall profits during this crisis; funds should be directed  towards financing state aid measures (including demand flexibility schemes or relief for energy-intensives) o   Refrain from introducing new policy  which would add to the industry’s production costs (including  ongoing files on climate, environment etc.). Particularly for energy-intensive industry, the current situation  calls for an emergency “survival mode”, to safeguard Europe’s economic and social stability: business as  usual is not an option. -   Medium term (structural reform): o   Speed up development of new electricity generation  capacity and infrastructure by reducing permitting  lead times and other barriers. This would make available larger amounts of electricity in the market and will  increase PPA volumes for industry. o   Energy market measures must include clear provisions encouraging long-term corporate power  purchase agreements  for carbon free electricity, especially aimed at electro-intensive industries, as  presently these instruments are not used in all Member States, thus preventing energy-intensive  consumers from hedging against electricity price increase. The short-term RES PPAs measures mentioned  above are equally valid for the medium term, if not implemented earlier . o   Incentivizing the necessary investments in new power plants, prioritizing security of supply and affordability;  any phase-out of traditional power sources must be preceded by the deployment of new  dispatchable generation and related storage  to ensure a smooth transition and avoid power shortages  and volatile prices. o   EU ETS prices to be maintained at a bearable level . o   Avoid introducing new policy measures that  could add to the industry’s production costs. Legal  uncertainty and policy predictability is vital for business environment, for Europe’s economic development  and avoidable policy-driven cost increases must be reexamined in the light of anticipated inflation and  recession.', 7: 'Annex 2: Updated list of closures and curtailments in the  Non-Ferrous Metals Sector since September 2021 The ongoing energy crisis continues to have a devastating effect on our sector. The non-ferrous metals industry  (including aluminium, copper, nickel, zinc, and silicon, amongst others) is characterised by extremely high levels of  electro-intensity, amounting to 40% of our overall production costs, under normal power price conditions. The recent surge in electricity prices has forced all EU’s zinc smelters, as well as over half of its aluminium smelters,  to curtail or even completely idle their production. Since October 2021, the EU has lost nearly half of its primary  aluminium capacity (around 1.000.000 tonnes). In the meantime, massive capacity additions are taking place outside  Europe with a far higher carbon footprint, more than replacing curtailed aluminium production in the EU. Zinc and  Silicon output have also been reduced since last fall. Due to curtailed output in Europe, zinc stocks are extremely  low with virtually no stock left in EU. To compensate for this shortage, Zinc is now imported from China. Chinese  production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European zinc production; 2,8 more in the case of aluminium  and 3,8 more for silicon. Zinc Closures and Curtailments All 9 electrolytic zinc smelters in the EU have been heavily affected by the power crisis, with many curtailing or  completely stopping production. Goldman Sachs has estimated 750,000 tonnes of suspended capacity, equivalent to  45% of total EU production (plus further reduction from Nyrstar Balen of around 160kt). Glencore (IT,  ES & DE) Glencore shut down Portovesme zinc smelter in Italy. See  here  and  here. The smelters in Asturias (Spain)  and Nordenham (Germany) have curtailed output. See  here . Nyrstar (NL  FR & BE Nyrstar announced that its Budel smelter – producing 315kt zinc annually – will be placed on care and  maintenance until further notice. See  here . Its other fully electrified zinc smelters in Belgium (Balen) and France  (Auby) have reduced production levels by up to 50%. See  here . Boliden (NO  & FI) Boliden Zinc smelters in Norway and Finland curtail production at times of electricity prices spikes. KCM (BG)   KCM zinc smelter in Bulgaria curtailed production due to high Electricity prices. See  here. Aluminium Closures and Curtailments Europe has lost around 1 million tonnes of its primary aluminium output due to curtailments and closures in 2021 and  2022. This is equivalent to 50% of the EU’s total primary aluminium production. Aldel (The  Netherlands) The only producer of primary aluminium in the Netherlands with a capacity of 110,000 tonnes, completely  curtailed production since October last year. 100 permanent staff and contractors have been laid off (see  here ).', 8: 'Alcoa (ES)   Alcoa to curtail the primary aluminum production at San Ciprián for two years with the commitment to initiate  its restart from 2024”. See  here. Alcoa (NO)  Alcoa to curtail one third of its production capacity at Lista smelter in Norway to mitigate high energy costs for  the site. See  here. Alro (RO)   Alro (Romania’s sole aluminium smelter) reduced its production by 60% and only 2 out of 5 production units  will operate in 2022. Personnel reductions at the aluminium smelter and alumina plant amount to 800 workers. Unions rallied in protest against the decision last week (see  here ). Alumina refinery (ALUM Tulcea) has temporarily suspended alumina production operations, starting with 1 st  of  August 2022 for an estimated period of 17 months. 500 people were laid off. Aluminium  Dunkirk (FR) The AIP smelter in Dunkirk, the biggest smelter in the EU with an annual capacity of about 285,000 t, cut  output by 15%. Further curtailments may be needed (see  here  &  here ). Talum (SL)   Talum lowered production from its Slovenian smelter to a third from November 1. It produced 114,581 tonnes  in 2021 (see  here ). Trimet (DE)   Trimet’s Voerde and Hamburg smelters announced a 30% reduction in the annual capacity of about 70, 000  tonnes per year (see  here ). In March, Trimet’s Essen smelter also reduced production by 50%, means  additional production loss of 82,500 tonnes per year (See  here ). Slovalco  (SL) Hydro announced the full closure of its Slovalco plant in Slovakia from September 2022, equivalent to 120,000  tonnes of aluminium annually (see  here ). Ferro-alloys and silicon Closures and Curtailments In the EEA and in the EU the production of ferro-alloys and silicon represents 3.2 Mio T, respectively 2 Mio T. In terms  of capacities in the EU, 27% of the silicon and ferro-alloys capacities have already been curtailed. In terms of the  number of furnaces having closed down, it represents 40 %. Aluminium Capacity Additions outside Europe In the meantime, massive capacity additions are taking place outside Europe with a far higher carbon footprint: Brazil   Alcoa  to restart Alumar aluminium smelter in a joint venture with Australian miner South32 Ltd. Hydro  to add capacity in its Albras smelter. Argentina   Aluar  aluminium smelter to ramp-up to full capacity after a deal on power supply was reached with the country’s  government. Australia   Alcoa  to restart 35 thousand metric tons of capacity at Portland Aluminium . Russia   Rusal  launched production at its long-stalled Taishet aluminium smelter in Siberia. Iran   I ncreases in aluminium production  by 118k ton y/y and another 100k ton on the way. India   Vedanta  increases production by 316k ton, another 414k ton on the way. Indonesia   Adaro Aluminum :  new 2m ton of production in Indonesia, new aluminum smelter in North Kalimantan. Huaqing Aluminum :  new thermal-powered primary aluminum smelter with capacity of 2 mton. If completed  as designed, the mega smelter will produce 2x what Europe curtailed because of the current energy crisis. China   P rimary aluminum production  run-rate set to expand by 2 mton in 2022. US   Century aluminium  restart at Mt Holly smelter. The company has been making significant capital investment  at the smelter, aimed at boosting its production capacity and creating additional well-paid jobs in the region.'}	('emissions_trading', 'not_supporting', [5])

Electricity sold over long-term power  purchase agreements must be exempted from revenue cap measures. •   Improve the temporary state aid framework , through raising the EUR 50 million threshold for relief  Member States can provide to struggling companies, adding support for companies temporarily reducing  or curtailing production (i.e. for short-term lay-off-costs), and making other crucial technical fixes. •   Actively promote and incentivize the use of renewable power purchase agreements , through  immediate regulatory action to improve conditions for industrial consumers, and a massively accelerated  roll-out of renewables generation. •   Minimise the impact of extra carbon costs from the Emissions Trading System , through: o   Issuing EU guidance to Member States requesting they provide the full allowed compensation of  indirect carbon costs (limiting the indirect costs to 1.5% of gross value added) o   Using the Market Stability Reserve to address excessive carbon prices which are adding extra  pressure onto the electricity price •   Provide further support to companies  through capping taxes and surcharges on electricity and gas,  creating an emergency EU relief fund for energy intensive industries. •   Implement schemes supporting short term interruptibility and demand response  flexibility and  critically provide support for longer term care and maintenance curtailments to increase the chance of  survival of impacted operations. More widely, it’s important that the European Commission avoids extra regulatory costs on suffering industries in this  critical period, diversifies sources of gas supply and evaluates options for temporary solidarity measures to rebalance  the windfall profits in other specific sectors during this crisis. The upcoming discussions on the electricity market and  long term energy supply are important to the European non-ferrous metals industry and we intend to play an active  role. We appeal for you to take swift and comprehensive action to address today’s crisis situation, in Friday’s emergency  summit and beyond. We would be pleased to discuss our concerns and recommendations further in a meeting with  you.

Sergio Zappa President and CEO, Normalien SpA Howard Winbow Director European Affairs', 5: 'Annex 1: Full list of measures addressing high energy prices We propose the following concrete solutions that go beyond energy market as this unfolding crisis requires a coordinated,  largescale policy response which matches the severity of today’s situation, that should put all policy options on the table. Structural reform of the energy market organization should be thoroughly analysed and hasty decisions should be avoided. -   Short term: o   Measures addressing the cost of fossil fuel power generators, aiming to reduce the price of power  offered to the market. Such measures would however need to be very carefully designed and  implemented as to not lead to increased consumption, particularly from storage facilities, and further  shortages of gas volumes, thus endangering security of supply and exacerbating the problem they seek to  tackle. o   Promote RES power purchase agreements (PPAs) through targeted schemes and immediate  regulatory intervention : ▪   Accelerate building of new RES generation to quickly make available larger amounts of electricity  in the market and PPA volumes for industry. ▪   Increase liquidity for PPAs by incentivizing existing and new generators to offer electricity for this  purpose (e.g. through tax incentives, reduced interest rates, green bonds, investment aid  conditional on signing PPAs in case of new generation capacity). ▪   Incentivise RES plants participating in auctions for state-backed PPAs to contract at least 50% of  the installed capacity/output through long-term corporate PPAs. ▪   State/EU guarantees to foster signing of RES PPAs with electro-intensive industry, as the Nordic  scheme or the Spanish FERGEI system. ▪   Addressing firming and shaping costs of RES PPAs, through schemes like the Green Pool; explore  the possibility of an EU-wide Green Pool-style solution that could help mitigate the impact of gas  on respective power prices. o   Reduced or capped taxes and surcharges  on electricity and gas for the energy intensive industries. o   Swiftly improve the temporary emergency state aid framework  as to provide useful and sufficient  conditions that actually help the most energy-intensive industry during this high energy prices crisis. The  eligibility period should be calculated based on the increase in costs since Q42020 and the eligibility  requirement to show a negative EBITDA should be removed as it does not reflect the financial reality -a  company’s EBITDA can be positive while making a net loss. The framework should clarify what can be  considered as an undertaking and the cap for maximum aid for energy-intensive consumers (50 million  EUR) should be significantly increased. Also, for decarbonization aid to ETS sectors, it should be clarified  that conditionality requirements based on ETS benchmarks should only be applicable in case where there  is a defined product benchmark (not for sectors under the heat and fuel fallback approach). o   Issue EU guidance to Member States encouraging full compensation  (indirect costs limited to 1.5%  of GVA) of indirect emissions costs of the EU ETS in all Member States. o   Create an emergency EU fund  that would offer urgent relief/mitigate soaring energy prices impact on  competitiveness of European energy-intensive industry. o   Ensure EU ETS prices 2  do not contribute  to the pressure on the electricity and gas price – use the  Market Stability Reserve to address excessive prices. o   Implement schemes supporting  interruptibility and demand response flexibility . 2  ETS prices do have an impact on electricity prices: a gas power plant emits around 0.4 tCO2/MWh, so when it sets the electricity price on the market, the CO2 pass-through cost is around 36 EUR/MWh (considering an ETS price of 90 EUR). It may not seem much in the context of present wholesale market prices, but the comparison should be made against the “normal” electricity prices before the crisis (40-60 EUR/MWh), thus reflecting accurately the impact of ETS prices.', 6: 'o   Temporary solidarity measures  addressing the windfall profits during this crisis; funds should be directed  towards financing state aid measures (including demand flexibility schemes or relief for energy-intensives) o   Refrain from introducing new policy  which would add to the industry’s production costs (including  ongoing files on climate, environment etc.). Particularly for energy-intensive industry, the current situation  calls for an emergency “survival mode”, to safeguard Europe’s economic and social stability: business as  usual is not an option. -   Medium term (structural reform): o   Speed up development of new electricity generation  capacity and infrastructure by reducing permitting  lead times and other barriers. This would make available larger amounts of electricity in the market and will  increase PPA volumes for industry. o   Energy market measures must include clear provisions encouraging long-term corporate power  purchase agreements  for carbon free electricity, especially aimed at electro-intensive industries, as  presently these instruments are not used in all Member States, thus preventing energy-intensive  consumers from hedging against electricity price increase. The short-term RES PPAs measures mentioned  above are equally valid for the medium term, if not implemented earlier . o   Incentivizing the necessary investments in new power plants, prioritizing security of supply and affordability;  any phase-out of traditional power sources must be preceded by the deployment of new  dispatchable generation and related storage  to ensure a smooth transition and avoid power shortages  and volatile prices. o   EU ETS prices to be maintained at a bearable level . o   Avoid introducing new policy measures that  could add to the industry’s production costs. Legal  uncertainty and policy predictability is vital for business environment, for Europe’s economic development  and avoidable policy-driven cost increases must be reexamined in the light of anticipated inflation and  recession.', 7: 'Annex 2: Updated list of closures and curtailments in the  Non-Ferrous Metals Sector since September 2021 The ongoing energy crisis continues to have a devastating effect on our sector. The non-ferrous metals industry  (including aluminium, copper, nickel, zinc, and silicon, amongst others) is characterised by extremely high levels of  electro-intensity, amounting to 40% of our overall production costs, under normal power price conditions. The recent surge in electricity prices has forced all EU’s zinc smelters, as well as over half of its aluminium smelters,  to curtail or even completely idle their production. Since October 2021, the EU has lost nearly half of its primary  aluminium capacity (around 1.000.000 tonnes). In the meantime, massive capacity additions are taking place outside  Europe with a far higher carbon footprint, more than replacing curtailed aluminium production in the EU. Zinc and  Silicon output have also been reduced since last fall. Due to curtailed output in Europe, zinc stocks are extremely  low with virtually no stock left in EU. To compensate for this shortage, Zinc is now imported from China. Chinese  production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European zinc production; 2,8 more in the case of aluminium  and 3,8 more for silicon. Zinc Closures and Curtailments All 9 electrolytic zinc smelters in the EU have been heavily affected by the power crisis, with many curtailing or  completely stopping production. Goldman Sachs has estimated 750,000 tonnes of suspended capacity, equivalent to  45% of total EU production (plus further reduction from Nyrstar Balen of around 160kt). Glencore (IT,  ES & DE) Glencore shut down Portovesme zinc smelter in Italy. See  here  and  here. The smelters in Asturias (Spain)  and Nordenham (Germany) have curtailed output. See  here . Nyrstar (NL  FR & BE Nyrstar announced that its Budel smelter – producing 315kt zinc annually – will be placed on care and  maintenance until further notice. See  here . Its other fully electrified zinc smelters in Belgium (Balen) and France  (Auby) have reduced production levels by up to 50%. See  here . Boliden (NO  & FI) Boliden Zinc smelters in Norway and Finland curtail production at times of electricity prices spikes. KCM (BG)   KCM zinc smelter in Bulgaria curtailed production due to high Electricity prices. See  here. Aluminium Closures and Curtailments Europe has lost around 1 million tonnes of its primary aluminium output due to curtailments and closures in 2021 and  2022. This is equivalent to 50% of the EU’s total primary aluminium production. Aldel (The  Netherlands) The only producer of primary aluminium in the Netherlands with a capacity of 110,000 tonnes, completely  curtailed production since October last year. 100 permanent staff and contractors have been laid off (see  here ).', 8: 'Alcoa (ES)   Alcoa to curtail the primary aluminum production at San Ciprián for two years with the commitment to initiate  its restart from 2024”. See  here. Alcoa (NO)  Alcoa to curtail one third of its production capacity at Lista smelter in Norway to mitigate high energy costs for  the site. See  here. Alro (RO)   Alro (Romania’s sole aluminium smelter) reduced its production by 60% and only 2 out of 5 production units  will operate in 2022. Personnel reductions at the aluminium smelter and alumina plant amount to 800 workers. Unions rallied in protest against the decision last week (see  here ). Alumina refinery (ALUM Tulcea) has temporarily suspended alumina production operations, starting with 1 st  of  August 2022 for an estimated period of 17 months. 500 people were laid off. Aluminium  Dunkirk (FR) The AIP smelter in Dunkirk, the biggest smelter in the EU with an annual capacity of about 285,000 t, cut  output by 15%. Further curtailments may be needed (see  here  &  here ). Talum (SL)   Talum lowered production from its Slovenian smelter to a third from November 1. It produced 114,581 tonnes  in 2021 (see  here ). Trimet (DE)   Trimet’s Voerde and Hamburg smelters announced a 30% reduction in the annual capacity of about 70, 000  tonnes per year (see  here ). In March, Trimet’s Essen smelter also reduced production by 50%, means  additional production loss of 82,500 tonnes per year (See  here ). Slovalco  (SL) Hydro announced the full closure of its Slovalco plant in Slovakia from September 2022, equivalent to 120,000  tonnes of aluminium annually (see  here ). Ferro-alloys and silicon Closures and Curtailments In the EEA and in the EU the production of ferro-alloys and silicon represents 3.2 Mio T, respectively 2 Mio T. In terms  of capacities in the EU, 27% of the silicon and ferro-alloys capacities have already been curtailed. In terms of the  number of furnaces having closed down, it represents 40 %. Aluminium Capacity Additions outside Europe In the meantime, massive capacity additions are taking place outside Europe with a far higher carbon footprint: Brazil   Alcoa  to restart Alumar aluminium smelter in a joint venture with Australian miner South32 Ltd. Hydro  to add capacity in its Albras smelter. Argentina   Aluar  aluminium smelter to ramp-up to full capacity after a deal on power supply was reached with the country’s  government. Australia   Alcoa  to restart 35 thousand metric tons of capacity at Portland Aluminium . Russia   Rusal  launched production at its long-stalled Taishet aluminium smelter in Siberia. Iran   I ncreases in aluminium production  by 118k ton y/y and another 100k ton on the way. India   Vedanta  increases production by 316k ton, another 414k ton on the way. Indonesia   Adaro Aluminum :  new 2m ton of production in Indonesia, new aluminum smelter in North Kalimantan. Huaqing Aluminum :  new thermal-powered primary aluminum smelter with capacity of 2 mton. If completed  as designed, the mega smelter will produce 2x what Europe curtailed because of the current energy crisis. China   P rimary aluminum production  run-rate set to expand by 2 mton in 2022. US   Century aluminium  restart at Mt Holly smelter. The company has been making significant capital investment  at the smelter, aimed at boosting its production capacity and creating additional well-paid jobs in the region.'}	('energy_transition_&_zero_carbon_technologies', 'not_supporting', [0, 1])

Our sector has already  been forced to make unprecedented curtailments in the last 12 months. We are deeply concerned that the winter ahead  could deliver a decisive blow to many of our operations, and we call on EU and Member State leaders to take emergency  action to preserve their strategic electricity-intensive industries and prevent permanent job losses. 50% of the EU’s aluminium and zinc capacity has already been forced offline due to the power crisis, as well as  significant curtailments in silicon and ferroalloys production and further impacts felt across copper and nickel sectors. In  the last month, several companies have had to announce indefinite closures and many more are on the brink ahead of  a life-or-death winter for many operations. Producers face electricity and gas costs over ten times higher than last year,  far exceeding the sales price for their products. We know from experience that once a plant is closed it very often  becomes a permanent situation, as re-opening implies significant uncertainty and cost. Europe’s clean energy goals require a competitive and growing metals sector to ensure a secure supply of the extra raw  materials needed to shift away from fossil fuels. Base metals, battery metals, and other metals are all needed in higher  volumes for Europe’s grid infrastructure, electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolysers, as  well as a complex web of other essential value chains across the European economy. We actively support your drive to  improve Europe’s strategic autonomy for its energy transition, and we want to make the long-term investments needed  into advancing and expanding our operations ready for 2050. But all metals production needs affordable and available electricity and gas, whether aluminium and zinc today or lithium  and cobalt tomorrow. We are deeply concerned that Europe faces a critical situation for the foreseeable future, with a  perfect storm of sky-high electricity prices, no energy market liquidity due to insecure gas supplies, a continued nuclear  and coal-phase out, and the remaining power sources being insufficient to cover market needs. Europe cannot have a successful energy and raw materials strategy if its power and gas prices stay at today’s levels for  a sustained period without relief. The long-term investment climate for all EU strategic metals operations and projects  risks being decimated, and more closures will follow next year once companies are not protected by their 2022 hedging  of the electricity price. Any further EU production loss will also increase global greenhouse gas emissions, due to  replacement supply from more polluting regions 1 . 1  Many metals are now imported from China and elsewhere. Chinese production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European  zinc production; 3 more in the case of aluminium and 3,8 more for silicon. We estimate that Europe’s replacement imports of aluminium  have already added 6-12 million tonnes of CO2 this year. September 2022', 1: 'We call on European and national leaders to look at all available options for safeguarding our companies and their  future.

{0: 'To:  President of the European Commission Ursula Von der Leyen, President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola, President of the European Council Charles Michel Cc: Executive Vice Presidents Frans Timmermans, Margrethe Vestager, Valdis Dombrovskis; Commissioners Thierry Breton, Paolo Gentiloni, Ms. Kadri Simson, European Commissioner for Energy RE: Europe’s non-ferrous metals producers call for emergency EU action to prevent permanent  deindustrialisation from spiralling electricity and gas prices Dear Ms President Von der Leyen, dear Ms President Metsola, dear Mr President Michel, Ahead of Friday’s emergency summit, the business leaders of Europe’s non-ferrous metals industry are writing together  to raise the alarm about Europe’s worsening energy crisis and its existential threat to our future. Our sector has already  been forced to make unprecedented curtailments in the last 12 months. We are deeply concerned that the winter ahead  could deliver a decisive blow to many of our operations, and we call on EU and Member State leaders to take emergency  action to preserve their strategic electricity-intensive industries and prevent permanent job losses. 50% of the EU’s aluminium and zinc capacity has already been forced offline due to the power crisis, as well as  significant curtailments in silicon and ferroalloys production and further impacts felt across copper and nickel sectors. In  the last month, several companies have had to announce indefinite closures and many more are on the brink ahead of  a life-or-death winter for many operations. Producers face electricity and gas costs over ten times higher than last year,  far exceeding the sales price for their products. We know from experience that once a plant is closed it very often  becomes a permanent situation, as re-opening implies significant uncertainty and cost. Europe’s clean energy goals require a competitive and growing metals sector to ensure a secure supply of the extra raw  materials needed to shift away from fossil fuels. Base metals, battery metals, and other metals are all needed in higher  volumes for Europe’s grid infrastructure, electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolysers, as  well as a complex web of other essential value chains across the European economy. We actively support your drive to  improve Europe’s strategic autonomy for its energy transition, and we want to make the long-term investments needed  into advancing and expanding our operations ready for 2050. But all metals production needs affordable and available electricity and gas, whether aluminium and zinc today or lithium  and cobalt tomorrow. We are deeply concerned that Europe faces a critical situation for the foreseeable future, with a  perfect storm of sky-high electricity prices, no energy market liquidity due to insecure gas supplies, a continued nuclear  and coal-phase out, and the remaining power sources being insufficient to cover market needs. Europe cannot have a successful energy and raw materials strategy if its power and gas prices stay at today’s levels for  a sustained period without relief. The long-term investment climate for all EU strategic metals operations and projects  risks being decimated, and more closures will follow next year once companies are not protected by their 2022 hedging  of the electricity price. Any further EU production loss will also increase global greenhouse gas emissions, due to  replacement supply from more polluting regions 1 . 1  Many metals are now imported from China and elsewhere. Chinese production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European  zinc production; 3 more in the case of aluminium and 3,8 more for silicon. We estimate that Europe’s replacement imports of aluminium  have already added 6-12 million tonnes of CO2 this year. September 2022', 1: 'We call on European and national leaders to look at all available options for safeguarding our companies and their  future. The crisis requires a complete package of solutions, and no option should be left off the table in this  unprecedented situation. Our urgent requests (further detailed in the Annex) are that the EU should: •   Take temporary action to address the excessive price of fossil fuel power generators , with an aim to  reduce the price of power offered to the market while not contributing to further shortages through increased  consumption. It is important that any mechanism does not reduce or remove incentives to enter into long  term power purchase agreements for energy intensive industry. Electricity sold over long-term power  purchase agreements must be exempted from revenue cap measures. •   Improve the temporary state aid framework , through raising the EUR 50 million threshold for relief  Member States can provide to struggling companies, adding support for companies temporarily reducing  or curtailing production (i.e. for short-term lay-off-costs), and making other crucial technical fixes. •   Actively promote and incentivize the use of renewable power purchase agreements , through  immediate regulatory action to improve conditions for industrial consumers, and a massively accelerated  roll-out of renewables generation. •   Minimise the impact of extra carbon costs from the Emissions Trading System , through: o   Issuing EU guidance to Member States requesting they provide the full allowed compensation of  indirect carbon costs (limiting the indirect costs to 1.5% of gross value added) o   Using the Market Stability Reserve to address excessive carbon prices which are adding extra  pressure onto the electricity price •   Provide further support to companies  through capping taxes and surcharges on electricity and gas,  creating an emergency EU relief fund for energy intensive industries. •   Implement schemes supporting short term interruptibility and demand response  flexibility and  critically provide support for longer term care and maintenance curtailments to increase the chance of  survival of impacted operations. More widely, it’s important that the European Commission avoids extra regulatory costs on suffering industries in this  critical period, diversifies sources of gas supply and evaluates options for temporary solidarity measures to rebalance  the windfall profits in other specific sectors during this crisis. The upcoming discussions on the electricity market and  long term energy supply are important to the European non-ferrous metals industry and we intend to play an active  role. We appeal for you to take swift and comprehensive action to address today’s crisis situation, in Friday’s emergency  summit and beyond. We would be pleased to discuss our concerns and recommendations further in a meeting with  you.

Sergio Zappa President and CEO, Normalien SpA Howard Winbow Director European Affairs', 5: 'Annex 1: Full list of measures addressing high energy prices We propose the following concrete solutions that go beyond energy market as this unfolding crisis requires a coordinated,  largescale policy response which matches the severity of today’s situation, that should put all policy options on the table. Structural reform of the energy market organization should be thoroughly analysed and hasty decisions should be avoided. -   Short term: o   Measures addressing the cost of fossil fuel power generators, aiming to reduce the price of power  offered to the market. Such measures would however need to be very carefully designed and  implemented as to not lead to increased consumption, particularly from storage facilities, and further  shortages of gas volumes, thus endangering security of supply and exacerbating the problem they seek to  tackle. o   Promote RES power purchase agreements (PPAs) through targeted schemes and immediate  regulatory intervention : ▪   Accelerate building of new RES generation to quickly make available larger amounts of electricity  in the market and PPA volumes for industry. ▪   Increase liquidity for PPAs by incentivizing existing and new generators to offer electricity for this  purpose (e.g. through tax incentives, reduced interest rates, green bonds, investment aid  conditional on signing PPAs in case of new generation capacity). ▪   Incentivise RES plants participating in auctions for state-backed PPAs to contract at least 50% of  the installed capacity/output through long-term corporate PPAs. ▪   State/EU guarantees to foster signing of RES PPAs with electro-intensive industry, as the Nordic  scheme or the Spanish FERGEI system. ▪   Addressing firming and shaping costs of RES PPAs, through schemes like the Green Pool; explore  the possibility of an EU-wide Green Pool-style solution that could help mitigate the impact of gas  on respective power prices. o   Reduced or capped taxes and surcharges  on electricity and gas for the energy intensive industries. o   Swiftly improve the temporary emergency state aid framework  as to provide useful and sufficient  conditions that actually help the most energy-intensive industry during this high energy prices crisis. The  eligibility period should be calculated based on the increase in costs since Q42020 and the eligibility  requirement to show a negative EBITDA should be removed as it does not reflect the financial reality -a  company’s EBITDA can be positive while making a net loss. The framework should clarify what can be  considered as an undertaking and the cap for maximum aid for energy-intensive consumers (50 million  EUR) should be significantly increased. Also, for decarbonization aid to ETS sectors, it should be clarified  that conditionality requirements based on ETS benchmarks should only be applicable in case where there  is a defined product benchmark (not for sectors under the heat and fuel fallback approach). o   Issue EU guidance to Member States encouraging full compensation  (indirect costs limited to 1.5%  of GVA) of indirect emissions costs of the EU ETS in all Member States. o   Create an emergency EU fund  that would offer urgent relief/mitigate soaring energy prices impact on  competitiveness of European energy-intensive industry. o   Ensure EU ETS prices 2  do not contribute  to the pressure on the electricity and gas price – use the  Market Stability Reserve to address excessive prices. o   Implement schemes supporting  interruptibility and demand response flexibility . 2  ETS prices do have an impact on electricity prices: a gas power plant emits around 0.4 tCO2/MWh, so when it sets the electricity price on the market, the CO2 pass-through cost is around 36 EUR/MWh (considering an ETS price of 90 EUR). It may not seem much in the context of present wholesale market prices, but the comparison should be made against the “normal” electricity prices before the crisis (40-60 EUR/MWh), thus reflecting accurately the impact of ETS prices.', 6: 'o   Temporary solidarity measures  addressing the windfall profits during this crisis; funds should be directed  towards financing state aid measures (including demand flexibility schemes or relief for energy-intensives) o   Refrain from introducing new policy  which would add to the industry’s production costs (including  ongoing files on climate, environment etc.). Particularly for energy-intensive industry, the current situation  calls for an emergency “survival mode”, to safeguard Europe’s economic and social stability: business as  usual is not an option. -   Medium term (structural reform): o   Speed up development of new electricity generation  capacity and infrastructure by reducing permitting  lead times and other barriers. This would make available larger amounts of electricity in the market and will  increase PPA volumes for industry. o   Energy market measures must include clear provisions encouraging long-term corporate power  purchase agreements  for carbon free electricity, especially aimed at electro-intensive industries, as  presently these instruments are not used in all Member States, thus preventing energy-intensive  consumers from hedging against electricity price increase. The short-term RES PPAs measures mentioned  above are equally valid for the medium term, if not implemented earlier . o   Incentivizing the necessary investments in new power plants, prioritizing security of supply and affordability;  any phase-out of traditional power sources must be preceded by the deployment of new  dispatchable generation and related storage  to ensure a smooth transition and avoid power shortages  and volatile prices. o   EU ETS prices to be maintained at a bearable level . o   Avoid introducing new policy measures that  could add to the industry’s production costs. Legal  uncertainty and policy predictability is vital for business environment, for Europe’s economic development  and avoidable policy-driven cost increases must be reexamined in the light of anticipated inflation and  recession.', 7: 'Annex 2: Updated list of closures and curtailments in the  Non-Ferrous Metals Sector since September 2021 The ongoing energy crisis continues to have a devastating effect on our sector. The non-ferrous metals industry  (including aluminium, copper, nickel, zinc, and silicon, amongst others) is characterised by extremely high levels of  electro-intensity, amounting to 40% of our overall production costs, under normal power price conditions. The recent surge in electricity prices has forced all EU’s zinc smelters, as well as over half of its aluminium smelters,  to curtail or even completely idle their production. Since October 2021, the EU has lost nearly half of its primary  aluminium capacity (around 1.000.000 tonnes). In the meantime, massive capacity additions are taking place outside  Europe with a far higher carbon footprint, more than replacing curtailed aluminium production in the EU. Zinc and  Silicon output have also been reduced since last fall. Due to curtailed output in Europe, zinc stocks are extremely  low with virtually no stock left in EU. To compensate for this shortage, Zinc is now imported from China. Chinese  production is 2,5 times more carbon intensive than European zinc production; 2,8 more in the case of aluminium  and 3,8 more for silicon. Zinc Closures and Curtailments All 9 electrolytic zinc smelters in the EU have been heavily affected by the power crisis, with many curtailing or  completely stopping production. Goldman Sachs has estimated 750,000 tonnes of suspended capacity, equivalent to  45% of total EU production (plus further reduction from Nyrstar Balen of around 160kt). Glencore (IT,  ES & DE) Glencore shut down Portovesme zinc smelter in Italy. See  here  and  here. The smelters in Asturias (Spain)  and Nordenham (Germany) have curtailed output. See  here . Nyrstar (NL  FR & BE Nyrstar announced that its Budel smelter – producing 315kt zinc annually – will be placed on care and  maintenance until further notice. See  here . Its other fully electrified zinc smelters in Belgium (Balen) and France  (Auby) have reduced production levels by up to 50%. See  here . Boliden (NO  & FI) Boliden Zinc smelters in Norway and Finland curtail production at times of electricity prices spikes. KCM (BG)   KCM zinc smelter in Bulgaria curtailed production due to high Electricity prices. See  here. Aluminium Closures and Curtailments Europe has lost around 1 million tonnes of its primary aluminium output due to curtailments and closures in 2021 and  2022. This is equivalent to 50% of the EU’s total primary aluminium production. Aldel (The  Netherlands) The only producer of primary aluminium in the Netherlands with a capacity of 110,000 tonnes, completely  curtailed production since October last year. 100 permanent staff and contractors have been laid off (see  here ).', 8: 'Alcoa (ES)   Alcoa to curtail the primary aluminum production at San Ciprián for two years with the commitment to initiate  its restart from 2024”. See  here. Alcoa (NO)  Alcoa to curtail one third of its production capacity at Lista smelter in Norway to mitigate high energy costs for  the site. See  here. Alro (RO)   Alro (Romania’s sole aluminium smelter) reduced its production by 60% and only 2 out of 5 production units  will operate in 2022. Personnel reductions at the aluminium smelter and alumina plant amount to 800 workers. Unions rallied in protest against the decision last week (see  here ). Alumina refinery (ALUM Tulcea) has temporarily suspended alumina production operations, starting with 1 st  of  August 2022 for an estimated period of 17 months. 500 people were laid off. Aluminium  Dunkirk (FR) The AIP smelter in Dunkirk, the biggest smelter in the EU with an annual capacity of about 285,000 t, cut  output by 15%. Further curtailments may be needed (see  here  &  here ). Talum (SL)   Talum lowered production from its Slovenian smelter to a third from November 1.

In March, Trimet’s Essen smelter also reduced production by 50%, means  additional production loss of 82,500 tonnes per year (See  here ). Slovalco  (SL) Hydro announced the full closure of its Slovalco plant in Slovakia from September 2022, equivalent to 120,000  tonnes of aluminium annually (see  here ). Ferro-alloys and silicon Closures and Curtailments In the EEA and in the EU the production of ferro-alloys and silicon represents 3.2 Mio T, respectively 2 Mio T. In terms  of capacities in the EU, 27% of the silicon and ferro-alloys capacities have already been curtailed. In terms of the  number of furnaces having closed down, it represents 40 %.

{0: '€ © 2 eDISON Edison’s response to the Commission adoption of a proposal on the Revision of Energy Performance of Buildings Directive Edison welcomes the revision of the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings proposed by the European Commission on 15 December 2021. This proposal aims to align interventions on the building stock of Member States with the 2030 goal of reducing GHG emissions by 55% relative to 1990. Edison believes that, if properly managed, the transition to a low-emission building sector is beneficial for both the climate and citizens, particularly vulnerable ones, who will be able to save on energy bills. This appears particularly urgent in light of the recent spike in energy prices. Also, such a transition offers an interesting opportunity for companies that provide energy services and stimuli to satellite economic activities in the construction sector, thereby incentivizing green growth. The revision of the Directive concerns a sector where Edison has been a leader for many years, offering services for the management of renovation contracts and for the improvement of energy efficiency in residential and non-residential buildings, both public and private. Based on our experience, we would like to point out the importance of public-private partnerships (PPPs), especially in light of the economic resources provided for in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (funded by Next Generation EU). We suggest that the Directive should be incisive in promoting PPPs and capable of guaranteeing a full transposition among Member States. The Directive should also provide for measures to simplify the use of PPPs as well as promote the training of public entities in the possibility of adopting PPPs and standardize the characteristics of these contracts to facilitate their usage. To stimulate building renovation, appropriate financial resources are necessary. Specifically, renovation can take place in a series of steps and over a certain period of years. Both public administrations and private organizations that use long-term contracts to cover the various steps of the work should be guaranteed the possibility of access to various incentivizing mechanisms, even if these mechanisms come after one or more steps of the work have already been completed and if they are an improvement on the incentives that were previously in place. Of course, these incentives shall be provided only if there is an improvement in the efficiency of the interventions. Project promoters should be given the possibility to switch from one incentivizing system to another if the latter is new and more advantageous than the previous one and, of course, when there are further efficiency interventions. To promote building renovation, project promoters should be able to seize all the investment opportunities, with the further possibility of renegotiating long-term contracts (such as with the public administration) when new support tools (e.g., superbonuses) occur and are particularly rewarding. This would incentivize the involvement of service companies and speed up investments. The Directive does not foresee an exemption for historical buildings from “minimum energy performance requirements”, which will be established by Member States and will be prescribed for important renovations. It is only foreseen that renovation of historical buildings must be adapted to the characteristics of the building. It would be necessary to foresee (generally) that all buildings (including public ones) that are difficult to renovate due to their characteristics should be exempted from the minimum energy performance requirements if their renovation is not technically and economically possible. Several historical', 1: '€ © 2 eDISON buildings in Italy could realistically become “nearly zero-emission” at most. We believe it would be more cost-effective to concentrate efforts and resources on building renovations that are actually feasible rather than those that are not feasible. Regarding the exclusion of certain buildings from the requirements (Article 5), we believe that it should not be made possible for Member States to exclude industrial sites from minimum energy requirements. On the contrary, a maximum ambition level should be pursued in improving energy performance in the industrial sector. Edison welcomes the proposal of the Commission to establish a “Renovation Passport” for buildings based on their energy performance, as it would provide interested parties and Member States with a roadmap of the renovations of a specific building, particularly if the works are carried out in different stages. The passport should facilitate the transparency of aspects related to increasing the energy performance of the building as well as track the updating of technical systems. Implementing the Renovation Passport — however useful and effective a tool it may be — should be simple, and attention should be given to the possibility that such an instrument may generate administrative costs or burdens. In this respect, is would also be necessary to guarantee, as much as possible, a standardization of certification procedures, especially as regards determining energy classes for buildings. The provision for on-site visits carried out by qualified, independent experts every five years is welcome, this should also be facilitated, and supervision is needed to evaluate whether it could generate significant costs or administrative burdens. The party bearing these costs should be supported and receive incentives where necessary. As regards, electric car charging stations, we believe that it would be important not to create excessive constraints on providers with respect to construction of recharging stations where predisposition exists. A more flexible approach calling for a proportion between charging stations and the area of parking lots/building size could be considered. It would probably be more efficient to provide for an increasing percentage of charging points in proportion to the spread of electric vehicles in the national car fleet. Possibly only fully electric vehicles should be considered because they most require the service. Furthermore, given the importance of decarbonizing private transport, it would be necessary to provide incentives and simplification of bureaucratic requirements for operators who provide, install, and manage charging stations or who provide charging services. To stimulate private investment, it is crucial that profitable business models for charging stations are favoured and that EV drivers have the possibility to access competitive and/or dedicated electricity tariffs. As concerns heating, we believe that multiple measures that facilitate improvement in energy performance should be favoured, and that a technologically neutral approach should be adopted. In default of this, some fuels that can improve building performance risk not being chosen, and specificities of some Member States risk being neglected. For this reason, we suggest revising the provision prohibiting Member States from incentivizing fossils fuels after 2027 and excluding gas solutions. Prohibiting gas solutions would be reflect a limited approach, whereas it is crucial to assess the role of gas heating plans in connection with the system of which they would become a part. As a matter of fact, systems are made up of many solutions, such as district heating and energy communities, where gas could play an enabling/complementary role that should not be discouraged. Moreover, Annex | of the Directive requires Member States to inform the', 2: '€ © 2 eDISON Commission of measures for gradually eliminating heating systems that use fossil fuels. This step would create uncertainty and the perception that all fossil fuels are about to be banned. This would be premature and might lead to foregoing emission reduction opportunities. Finally, we agree that the sanctions foreseen for violations of national regulations adopted in accordance with the Directive must be effective, proportional, and dissuasive.'}	('energy_transition_&_zero_carbon_technologies', 'opposing', [1, 2])

It would probably be more efficient to provide for an increasing percentage of charging points in proportion to the spread of electric vehicles in the national car fleet. Possibly only fully electric vehicles should be considered because they most require the service. Furthermore, given the importance of decarbonizing private transport, it would be necessary to provide incentives and simplification of bureaucratic requirements for operators who provide, install, and manage charging stations or who provide charging services. To stimulate private investment, it is crucial that profitable business models for charging stations are favoured and that EV drivers have the possibility to access competitive and/or dedicated electricity tariffs. As concerns heating, we believe that multiple measures that facilitate improvement in energy performance should be favoured, and that a technologically neutral approach should be adopted. In default of this, some fuels that can improve building performance risk not being chosen, and specificities of some Member States risk being neglected. For this reason, we suggest revising the provision prohibiting Member States from incentivizing fossils fuels after 2027 and excluding gas solutions. Prohibiting gas solutions would be reflect a limited approach, whereas it is crucial to assess the role of gas heating plans in connection with the system of which they would become a part. As a matter of fact, systems are made up of many solutions, such as district heating and energy communities, where gas could play an enabling/complementary role that should not be discouraged. Moreover, Annex | of the Directive requires Member States to inform the', 2: '€ © 2 eDISON Commission of measures for gradually eliminating heating systems that use fossil fuels. This step would create uncertainty and the perception that all fossil fuels are about to be banned. This would be premature and might lead to foregoing emission reduction opportunities. Finally, we agree that the sanctions foreseen for violations of national regulations adopted in accordance with the Directive must be effective, proportional, and dissuasive.'}	('energy_and_resource_efficiency', 'not_supporting', [0, 1, 2])

"{0: '2 a IBEBIC = Q Business | Your Money | Market Data | Companies | Economy | Technology of Business CEO Secrets | Global Trade Energy boss warns higher bills are here to stay © 1 hour ago Climate change | By Dearbail Jordan & Lucy Hooker Business reporters, BBC News The boss of Norwegian energy giant Equinor has said he does not expect gas and electricity bills to return to the levels they were before Covid.', 1: 'Anders Opedal told the BBC the transition from fossil fuels towards less damaging sources of energy meant costs would remain high. Mr Opedal also said that windfall taxes on energy firms were affecting investment in projects in the UK. Energy companies have reported record profits because of higher gas prices. Equinor, which makes most of its money producing oil and gas, is one of Europe\'s biggest energy companies, with operations in 36 countries around the world including the UK. In its most recent financial results, it reported pre-tax profits of $24.3bn (£19.8bn) between July and September compared to $9.7bn in the same period the year before. ¢ What is a windfall tax? Wholesale prices rose as Covid restrictions began to ease but soared higher after Russia invaded Ukraine and countries targeted the Kremlin with sanctions. In recent weeks, in part due to warmer than usual weather across Europe, gas prices have returned to where they were before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, gas and electricity bills for households and businesses remain elevated and are squeezing living costs for many. Mr Opedal said it was doubtful that gas and electricity bills would return to a time when the typical UK household was paying around £1,300 a year. The typical annual bill for homes is currently around £2,500 which includes help from the UK government. Mr Opedal said there is ""a kind of re-wiring of the whole energy system in Europe particularly after the gas from Russia was taken away"". He said huge investment in renewables was needed, including using more hydrogen for example.', 2: '""This will require a lot of investment and these investments need to be paid for, so | would assume that the energy bills may slightly be higher than in the past but not as volatile and high as we have today,"" Mr Opedal said. Looking ahead, he said ""we need to treat energy as something that is not abundant"". ""| think we have had a lot of cheaper energy in the past and we probably wasted some of it, so we need to make sure we\'re making the right investments now [and] everyone [should] use as little energy as possible."" Mr Opedal spoke to the BBC before attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland which is an annual gathering of political and business leaders. The theme of this year\'s meeting, which takes place from 16-20 January, is ""Cooperation in a fragmented world"". Mr Opedal took over as chief executive and president of Equinor in November 2020 with a pledge to be ""a force"" in the shift to green energy. He started his career as a petroleum engineer. ¢ Net zero delay will hurt economy, MP’s review says Last year, the UK introduced a windfall tax on energy companies that have benefitted from the spike in prices. Initially 25%, the so-called Energy Profits Levy will rise to 35% in January and remain in place until March 2028. The tax applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not from other activities such as refining oil and selling petrol and diesel on forecourts.', 3: 'The scheme also lets firms claim tax savings worth 91p of every £1 invested in fossil fuel extraction in the UK. Mr Opedal said that while the tax had not impacted Equinor\'s investment strategy in the UK: ""It is affecting how we judge each project because we have to take into account what is the tax level compared to what are all the other risks."" He cited the Rosebank oilfield off the coast of Shetland which Equinor is seeking to develop, pending government approval. Equinor says the field could produce almost 70,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak, accounting for 8% of the UK\'s total oil production between 2026 and 2030. However, environmental campaigners have described the plans as a ""total betrayal"" of the UK\'s climate goals. GETTY IMAGES Mr Opedal said: ""There have been two changes in the tax regime already and we\'re thinking about will it even be more going forward? Rosebank is a project that we think is needed in the UK in terms of energy security."" He added: ""Uncertainty about what will the tax level be will be an important part of the decision [to go ahead] because, for instance, now on some of the fields we have invested in we are still not profitable but pay tax already based on the windfall taxes. So this is how we kind of evaluate every project."" Equinor\'s Norwegian operations account for around two thirds of its oil and gas business. The rest of its oil and gas business is spread across 30 countries,', 4: ""with two of its largest operations the Peregrino field in Brazil and the Mariner field off Shetland, which started production in 2019. The firm also has investments in renewables including hydroelectric power. It recently announced plans with Germany's RWE to develop hydrogen-ready power plants.

If global emissions continue as projected it will take approximately 60,000 million tonnes per annum or “MTPA"", of CO2 emissions reductions by 2050 to hit the 1.5-degree target. To do this requires many different solutions improving over time. As we show here, a large portion is projected to come from reduced emissions, improved energy efficiency, increased zero-emissions power supply, and fuel switching. The other significant requirement is carbon capture. Either at the emissions source or from the air where carbon removal solutions can reach difficult to decarbonize sources. Uniquely, Carbon Removals like Direct Air Capture can also reach the emissions that are already in the atmosphere. As the world has spent time with the various net-zero pathways, the appreciation for Carbon Capture and Direct Air Capture has increased. As noted in the recent IPCC climate update, the need for near-term industrial scale carbon removals is urgent and becomes even more necessary with any delays across other solutions.

That's why E.ON is investing in thousands of new, ultra-fast charging points across Europe in the coming years. To install 2,000 of these charging stations by the end of 2024, the energy company has now teamed up with leading charging station manufacturer alpitronic. As part of a strategic partnership, the two companies are driving forward the expansion of charging infrastructure and the switch to electric vehicles throughout Europe. The market for electromobility continues to grow rapidly. By 2030, at least 15 million electric vehicles are expected to be registered in Germany. The resulting increase in energy demand requires the expansion and e�icient management of the charging infrastructure. The 2,000 new fast-charging stations will complement the existing charging network of E.ON and its business customers. E.ON Drive customers can already conveniently charge their e-cars at around 160,000 public charging points in Germany and other European countries. By 2026, E.ON plans to install a total of around 5,000 new fast-charging points. Plans include both the expansion of existing sites and the construction of completely new stations for public charging and for E.ON's business customers. E.ON will use the stations to implement holistic decarbonization projects and enable customers to charge their ﬂeets of cars, vans and heavy commercial vehicles in an environmentally friendly way. The latest generation of alpitronic fast-charging columns with outputs of between 150 and infrastructure for passenger cars and heavy commercial vehicles in Europe Outputs of up to 400 kW for future-oriented charging for business customers and in public areas • Project launched for megawatt charging of electric trucks: First pilot sites to be established by 2024 • Patrick Lammers, E.ON Management Board member responsible for the customer solutions business : “Electromobility is a key factor in advancing the energy transition and saving CO 2  emissions. To ensure that even more people switch to electric driving in the future, charging must work as quickly and conveniently as possible. At E.ON, we're therefore determined on pushing the expansion of infrastructure throughout Europe and fostering new and innovative technologies for smart charging.” Philipp Senoner, CEO and co-founder of alpitronic : “The close exchange with our partners along the value chain for charging infrastructure is essential to o�er customer- oriented charging solutions. At alpitronic, this allows us to provide reliable and future- oriented charging stations and thus increase the acceptance of electromobility.”"", 2: '08/08/2022, 15:52 E.ON and alpitronic set the pace for electromobility: 2,000 more stations and new charging solutions for ultra-fast charging b… https://www.eon.com/en/about-us/media/press-release/2022/eon-and-alpitronic-set-the-pace-for-electromobility.html 3/6 300 kW will be used. Depending on the electric vehicle, electricity for a range of 100 kilometers can be charged in ﬁve minutes. The new HYC400 High Power Charger with outputs of up to 400 kW and the HYC50, the ﬁrst wall-mountable 50 kW charger, will also be available to E.ON customers in the future. The increased e�iciency of 97 percent will reduce energy losses to around half with this generation, which in turn has a considerable e�ect on saving CO 2  emissions. Joint innovations for convenient and intelligent charging With the ramp-up of electromobility, the intelligent integration of charging infrastructure into the power grids is becoming increasingly important. Further optimization of operation also plays a central role. Against this background, the partnership between E.ON and alpitronic goes far beyond the installation of new charging stations. Both companies have set themselves the goal of jointly driving forward the development of innovative solutions for smart charging. Among other things, the potential of intelligent load management in conjunction with time-variable electricity tari�s is being investigated. In addition, E.ON and alpitronic want to further improve the customer experience at the charging station. The focus here is on technically optimizing the interaction between the vehicle, the fast charging station and the billing system, as well as Plug&Charge. The two partners are also pooling their expertise in the introduction of charging solutions for heavy commercial vehicles, for example for future megawatt charging. The ﬁrst pilot sites with current fast-charging infrastructure for trucks are to be established at several locations in Europe by 2024.

In addition, their use has led to growing production costs for farmers. Regenerative agriculture can help solve this issue by protecting soils, biodiversity and water, and serving as a model that’s more resilient for the farmers themselves. However, the huge investment and long-term commitment required in areas such as land and technology are often a blocker to scaling up promising solutions. That's why Unilever, AXA and Tikehau Capital intend to work together, entering a six-month due diligence process to land the theory of an investment tool that will help accelerate the shift of agriculture and food value chains towards regenerative practices. This shift is only possible if there’s close collaboration between all parties from farmers, producers and manufacturers to retailers, technology providers and financial investors. The fund aims to promote, establish and nurture this collaboration. What is regenerative agriculture? Agriculture, forest and land use together are the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and the main driver of biodiversity loss. Regenerative agriculture practices can reverse this trend and play a crucial role in addressing climate change and environmental challenges. It's an approach to farming that works in harmony with nature to ensure the long-term viability and resilience of the land. It builds soil health, crop resilience and nutrient density as well as protecting water and increasing biodiversity. Ultimately, it is about restoring the health of the soils where our food is grown which, in return, will enhance our own health. A unique combination of expertise Between Unilever, AXA and Tikehau Capital, we bring a unique set of industry, risk and financial expertise through which we’re aiming to drive the structural changes required. We each intend to invest €100 million to be deployed over the fund's life. But we anticipate that public and institutional investors, as well as other Cookie settings 7YE'S: will join too. The target is €1 billion. https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2022/new-tool-to-help-accelerate-the-transition-to-regenerative-agriculture/"", 2: '8/30/22, 11:36 AM New tool to accelerate regenerative agriculture transition | Unilever The fund will focus on three main areas. Protecting soil health to enhance biodiversity, preserve water resource and fight climate change. Ensuring the future supply of regenerative ingredients to meet the needs of a growing global population and consumer demand for increasingly sustainable products. And helping unlock technology-based solutions. “We know that a key way to address climate change is through nature, and agriculture is a part of that solution,” says Eric Soubeiran, who is VP of Unilever’s Climate & Nature Fund. “This is why in 2020 Unilever committed to invest €1 billion in climate and nature projects, connecting value chain transformation with our business and brands, allowing us to take targeted and meaningful action to address climate change and grow responsibly.” The launch of the fund could not be more timely In April, the UN published its Global Land Outlook in which it noted that 52% of agricultural land was degraded and that, if nothing is done now, by 2050 an additional 16 million square kilometres would go the same way. That’s an area the size of South America. The UN also highlighted the role of sustained financing from developed countries and the private sector as a key enabler to fight land degradation and scale up regenerative agriculture. AXA Climate and Tikehau Capital As a pioneer in the field of climate and environmental adaptation, AXA Climate will play an integral role in launching and deploying the fund. This AXA subsidiary will contribute through its expertise in climate, environmental and agricultural risk management, and in impact monitoring (particularly via satellite technology), supported by its granular knowledge of the agriculture sector. Tikehau Capital will bring its experience and expertise in climate-related investments. Having launched the first fund dedicated to the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the economy in 2018, Tikehau Capital now has almost €2 billion of assets under management focused on climate action across its various asset classes.

Then Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. Now the Biden administration is listening closely to Chevron, say people familiar with the conversations, which says it can help double Venezuela’s 800,000 barrels-a-day production within months. That could replace the loss of roughly 700,000 barrels a day the U.S. was importing from Russia before it attacked Ukraine. And it could help lower gasoline prices—a major concern for the Biden administration in a tough election year. “Chevron came in November, they pitched it around, but got laughed out of town,” said Juan Cruz, a former National Security Council official in charge of the Western Hemisphere who has closely followed the Biden administration’s policy toward Venezuela. “But what was really funny in November is a plan today.” Since the Russians invaded on Feb. 24 and President Biden has canceled Russian oil imports, Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has offered the company’s help to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in shoring up U.S. energy supplies by ramping up production in Venezuela, according to people briefed on the talks. Chevron is the only major U.S. producer to retain assets in Venezuela following nationalizations by the Socialist government and, much later, U.S. sanctions. Granting the San Ramon, California-based company and other U.S. producers permits to operate could boost Venezuelan production while keeping other sanctions in effect. Broadly easing sanctions on Venezuela faces stiff opposition in the U.S. over concerns it would prop up the country’s autocratic regime.

But years of mismanagement, corruption and nationalization of oil ventures led production to fall from 3.2 million barrels a day in the 1990s to a 10th of that in 2020. Since then, production has more than doubled as Venezuela turned to opaque foreign companies to boost production, say industry executives. Chevron’s lobbyists assert that the recent production increases show that the U.S. sanctions aren’t working as intended. But while Chevron has told U.S. officials it could boost production quickly, some oil analysts who closely track Venezuela doubt the company could deliver. Even in good times, Venezuela had never increased production anywhere near the level of recent optimistic projections, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute. Chevron’s perseverance in Venezuela has come as the company has tried to get Venezuela to pay money owed under production-sharing agreements. The company wrote down all of its assets there in 2020, taking a charge of $2.6 billion. Nonetheless, it stayed, receiving periodic licenses from the U.S. government to retain but not operate assets. Russia’s attack on Ukraine helped push the price of oil to over $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Here’s how rising oil costs could further boost inflation across the U.S. economy.

"{0: '12 Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) The IEA Net Zero 2050 1  scenario forecasts that 50% of fuels used in aviation will be low emissions by 2040. Therefore, net zero goals in the aviation industry are dependent upon large-scale projects. At Valero, we believe that low-carbon aviation fuels will be part of the energy mix. 1  International Energy Agency (2021),  Net Zero by 2050. A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector , IEA, Paris. Over the last decade Valero has become a leading manufacturer of low-carbon fuels, which offer lower GHG emissions. In the next decade, we will focus on bringing creative and innovative approaches to the decarbonization of transportation fuels. The following technological advances are examples of innovation that we are developing or evaluating: Innovation  for a  Low-carbon Future At Valero, we believe that liquid fuels are the  affordable solution to reduce transportation GHG  emissions in a reliable manner. Fuels are essential  to drive progress and create long-term value for our  stockholders while helping to realize a more viable  trajectory for the global economy. We are evaluating the engineering capability to add SAF production to the new renewable diesel facility in Port Arthur. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) is another low-carbon pathway to produce SAF. In this process alcohols are converted to SAF using catalytic steps similar to those used in existing petroleum refining processes. Our large network of low-carbon ethanol plants and our leading refining expertise provide us with an advantage in the potential development of this product. Large-scale SAF production could also be a demand driver for low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and renewable power projects.', 1: 'ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE REPORT  •   13 Low-carbon  Hydrogen Hydrogen is important in refinery operations as it is used to lower the sulfur content of fuels. Low-carbon hydrogen has become a critical technology in the various decarbonization pathways. In part due to the acceleration of renewable energy and carbon sequestration, studies around scalability of this technology show how quickly the industry is moving to reach parity with current technologies. Valero intends to use low-carbon hydrogen, produced from renewable propane, to reduce the amount of fossil-fuel- derived hydrogen used in renewable diesel production. At our Corpus Christi refinery, we use renewable natural gas from municipal solid waste to produce low-carbon transportation fuels. We expect to process nearly 1 trillion BTUs of renewable natural gas in 2022 and nearly 3.7 trillion BTUs of renewable natural gas in 2023. These resulting low-carbon transportation fuels are valued at a premium and are exported to Europe to meet certain GHG emission reduction goals. Renewable  Naphtha Renewable naphtha is already produced at Valero’s renewable diesel plants. Renewable naphtha is a gasoline blending component that lowers the carbon intensity of gasoline. It can also be used in plastic production, resulting in low-carbon plastics. Renewable naphtha can also be used in the production of low-carbon hydrogen. Valero is supporting Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in the development of a solid filtration membrane to remove CO 2  from the exhaust tailpipe of internal combustion engine vehicles. The objective of this revolutionary technology is to reduce CO 2  emissions in the atmosphere with an affordable solution that lowers life cycle GHG emissions. In concept, applying this technology to vehicles running on low-carbon fuels would result in net negative life cycle carbon emissions, exceeding the performance of any competing technology (including EVs and hydrogen fuel cells).

Compared to 2016 levels, these plans are expected to achieve: 20-30% reduction in corporate-wide greenhouse gas intensity and an absolute reduction of approximately 20% (or approximately 23 million metric tons). 40-50% reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity and an absolute reduction of approximately 30% (or approximately 15 million metric tons).  70-80% reduction in corporate-wide methane intensity.  60-70% reduction in corporate-wide flaring intensity. These plans are also expected to achieve World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030. Similarly, absolute flaring and methane emissions are expected to decrease by 60% and 70%, respectively. These emission-reduction plans cover Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from assets the Company operates. For non-operated assets, the Company works with its equity partners to advance greenhouse gas reductions to achieve comparable results. I N V E S T I N G  $ 1 5  B I L L I O N  I N  L O W E R - E M I S S I O N O P P O R T U N I T I E S Over the next six years, we plan to invest more than $15 billion on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions. A significant share is focused on scaling up carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Stronger policy further accelerates development and deployment of lower-emission technologies, and would provide ExxonMobil additional investment opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Company's robust research and development process, continued evaluation of emerging technologies, and global collaborations will be key to identifying and growing lower-emission opportunities. A D V O C A T I N G  F O R  S U P P O R T I V E  P O L I C I E S Sound government policies are needed to accelerate the deployment of key technologies at the pace and scale required to support a net-zero future. Supportive policies can provide direct investment and incentives in the same way they have accelerated growth for wind, solar and electric vehicles. We have long supported an explicit price on carbon to establish market incentives and provide the stability required for investments. In the absence of economy-wide carbon-pricing systems, well-designed, sector-based policy options to drive innovation and investment could also be an effective way to reduce emissions. We’ve also played a leadership role in advocating for high-impact policies to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas operations while implementing methane-reducing technologies and processes in our operations. R E S I L I E N T  U N D E R  N E T - Z E R O  P A T H W A Y S This report includes an analysis of ExxonMobil’s business and investment portfolio under the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario. The scenario illustrates the dramatic societal changes and massive levels of investment required – in a very short period of time – to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Although governments are not implementing changes at the level and pace assumed in the IEA NZE scenario, the detailed assumptions contained in the report enable us to further test the resiliency of our businesses and strategy. The IEA’s assumptions demonstrate the significant role ExxonMobil can play in the transition and the growth potential for chemicals, low-emission fuels, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen. ExxonMobil is positioned to successfully compete in these businesses by leveraging its capabilities and repurposing assets. Throughout the modeled period, IEA NZE’s assumed carbon price supports attractive investments in key growth areas that drive increases in cash flow. The Company’s core capabilities, experience and advantages in scale, integration, technology, project execution and people would remain critical success factors in this assumed transition path. As the energy system evolves, ExxonMobil will continue to test the resiliency of its business strategy to ensure the Company can deliver shareholder value across a wide range of future scenarios.""}"	('supporting_the_need_for_regulations', 'no_position_or_mixed_position', [0])
"{0: '27/02/2023, 10:54 Vodafone and Centrica agree second major solar Power Purchase Agreement with Mytilineos | Centrica plc https://www.centrica.com/media-centre/news/2023/vodafone-and-centrica-agree-second-major-solar-power-purchase-agreement-with-mytilineos/ 1/2 21 February 2023 Vodafone and Centrica agree second major solar Power Purchase Agreement with Mytilineos Gives Vodafone access to clean, high quality and affordable renewable electricity for 10 years. The five solar farms will generate a total of 216 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity and displace more than 53,000 tonnes of CO 2 UK-based renewable power sources will provide around 44 % of Vodafone UK’s annual energy requirement by 2025. Vodafone and Centrica have signed a second major corporate Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with MYTILINEOS S.A for the output from five solar farms under construction in England, which will output 216 gigawatt hours of green power. ""Power purchase agreements such as this are going to be essential to the growth of renewable energy in the UK and Europe, helping secure guaranteed returns for developers, and encouraging growth in the sector."" Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive Officer of Centrica The deal gives Vodafone UK access to clean, high quality and affordable renewable electricity for the next ten years, offering price certainty and improved energy security. Already in the UK, 100% of the grid electricity Vodafone uses is from certified renewable sources. Combined with agreements already in place, this new solar PPA means around 44% of its annual energy requirement will come from UK-based renewable power sources by 2025. The five solar farms, located in Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Buckinghamshire and Dorset, will generate a total of 216GWh of electricity and displace more than 53,000 tonnes of CO 2 e - every year 1 , the equivalent of taking around 31,400 cars off the road 2 . Construction will begin this year with energy generation expected from early 2024. Vodafone will purchase a significant proportion of the electricity output from the solar farms, securing their development and bringing additional renewable power provision to the UK grid. The remainder will be sold through Centrica’s Energy Marketing & Trading business. ""The energy crisis has highlighted we must work together – as governments, businesses and society – to change how we produce and consume energy. Today’s announcement ensures a significant proportion of our energy requirement, for at least the next 10 years, is home-grown in the UK."" Ahmed Essam, UK CEO, Vodafone The deal, between Vodafone, Centrica as the power supplier and MYTILINEOS as the generator, supports the UK government’s ambition to focus on home-grown, clean and more affordable energy and so boost long-term energy independence and security. Power Purchase Agreements are key to Vodafone’s renewable energy procurement strategy. Today’s news follows an announcement last year to purchase a significant proportion of power from  three new UK solar farms  for the supply of 109 GWh of renewable electricity. The first of these is now fully operational with the others to follow in the coming months. Combined with two onshore wind farms, in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire, Vodafone UK has secured access to renewable power from 10 sites across the UK. Ahmed Essam, UK CEO, Vodafone, said: “The energy crisis has highlighted we must work together – as governments, businesses and society – to change how we produce and consume energy. Today’s announcement ensures a significant proportion of our energy requirement, for at least the next 10 years, is home-grown in the UK.” ""I’m pleased Vodafone is helping to progress the development of new renewable power sites and supporting the delivery of green energy to the UK grid. Importantly, this also gives Vodafone UK improved energy security and price certainty and will help us achieve net zero 3  for our UK operations by 2027."" Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive Officer of Centrica said: “Power purchase agreements such as this are going to be essential to the growth of renewable energy in the UK and Europe, helping secure guaranteed returns for developers, and encouraging growth in the sector. They are also key to how large organisations like Vodafone decarbonise their operations. We’re delighted to build on our longstanding relationship with Vodafone and support them on their net zero journey.” Yiannis Kalafatas, Chief Executive Director of MYTILINEOS’ Energy Sector stated: “We are excited about this second transaction with Vodafone, as this demonstrates our capability to support renewable energy and energy independency in the UK. We are also proud of being able to achieve such a milestone - both as a developer and a generator – by signing the biggest solar corporate PPA deal in the UK to date.” Vodafone UK Media Relations Team T:  01635 693693 E:  ukmediarelations@vodafone.com Michael Pullan, Head of Digital Communications T:  07557 619446', 1: '27/02/2023, 10:54 Vodafone and Centrica agree second major solar Power Purchase Agreement with Mytilineos | Centrica plc https://www.centrica.com/media-centre/news/2023/vodafone-and-centrica-agree-second-major-solar-power-purchase-agreement-with-mytilineos/ 2/2 E:  michael.pullan@centrica.com'}"	('renewable_energy', 'supporting', [0])

The Prime Minister announced support from the French Government for ArcelorMittalʼs decarbonisation programme in France, which involves a €1.7 billion investment in its Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites in France. This investment will enable a profound transformation of steelmaking in France and a total reduction of close to 40% or 7.8 million tonnes per year in ArcelorMittalʼs CO2 emissions in France by 2030. This transformation will represent a 10% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing industry in France and put Franceʼs steelmaking industry on the path of the Paris Agreement. The transformation of steelmaking operations will generate positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.

This new unit will complement the ladle furnace announced last March and supported by Franceʼs recovery plan, ʻFrance Relanceʼ. Together these investments will turn Fos-sur-Mer into a reference site for the production of low carbon, circular steel, made from recycled steel; In Dunkirk, ArcelorMittal will build a 2.5 million tonne Direct Reduction of Iron (DRI) unit to transform iron ore using hydrogen instead of coal. This DRI will be coupled with an innovative technology electric furnace and completed by an additional Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Other investments are already under way to continue to increase the proportion of scrap steel used. The new industrial facilities will be operational starting in 2027 and will gradually replace 3 out of 5 of ArcelorMittalʼs blast furnaces in France by 2030 (2 out of 3 in Dunkirk, 1 out of 2 in Fos). Decarbonising the Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites will contribute to maintaining and developing the French steelmaking industry. It will also support the strengthening and development of local ecosystems, generating positive and sustainable dynamics for employment and industrial activity in France, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas. Commenting, Eric Niedziela, Chairman of ArcelorMittal France and Vice President Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, said: “ArcelorMittal is honored that the French State supports our projects. We are proud to have this unique opportunity to contribute to the objectives of the France 2030 plan and to maintaining a strong manufacturing industry in France, serving European markets. ArcelorMittalʼs management team and its 15,500 employees in France are mobilised to succeed in this new industrial revolution and we will be happy to welcome new talents willing to participate in this extraordinary adventure.” Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products, added:  “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonising its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture. We are grateful for this support from the French State which will enable the major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittalʼs flat steel production in Europe.” Matthieu Jehl, CEO of ArcelorMittal France, said: “This support makes possible the extremely high investments we need to make to decarbonise steelmaking on our Dunkirk site, Europeʼs largest steel producing site. We will therefore continue transforming our sites in France to deliver our customers with low carbon steel.” Bruno Ribo, CEO of ArcelorMittal Méditerranée, said: “Our Fos-sur-Mer site will undergo a first-of-a-kind transformation to decarbonize. Our teams are already implementing a first investment – our ladle furnace – which will increase our production of low carbon steel.

No renewables powerhouse, says BP Angela Macdonald-Smith  Senior resources writer Nov 2, 2022 – 11.00am Australia absolutely needs its own version of the US’s Inﬂation Reduction Act (IRA) to lure billions of dollars of international capital investment in clean energy needed to meet emissions reduction targets that will otherwise be directed elsewhere, according to the head of BP in Australia. The IRA is “tipping the scale” in enhancing the attractiveness of the United States [https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/make-america-the-green-investment-capital-of-the- world-20220810-p5b8v8]  as a destination for transition investments globally, and Australia needs to match up to fulﬁl its huge potential to become a real “sweet spot” in the global energy revolution, said Frederic Baudry. Exclusive BP Australia president Frederic Baudry in Jakarta, Indonesia, this week. Achmad Ibrahim', 1: '03/11/2022, 12:32 BP Australia president Frederic Baudry calls for policy to support hydrogen, clean fuels https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/no-policy-no-renewables-powerhouse-says-bp-20221031-p5bu9i 2/5 He has been pressing the message home with federal and state ministers in recent weeks that BP is keen to move ahead with its portfolio of major transition investments in Western Australia, including green hydrogen, sustainable fuels [https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/bp-s-green-transformation-starts-with-kwinana- 20220520-p5amzb]  and the decarbonisation of LNG, to help meet climate targets but that they are not economic without supporting policy. “The IRA is a game-changer between traditional and renewable energy inside the US, it’s a game-changer between the US and the rest of the world, because capital is ﬁnite,” Mr Baudry told  The Australian Financial Review . “We must respond, we must respond with policy in Australia, because Australia has all the ingredients to be that [clean energy] powerhouse ... it has all the elements ... but we have to create the policy settings to divert investment to the country.” Mr Baudry, a French national who has headed up the British energy giant’s operations in Australia since January 2020, said BP has singled out Australia as one of three key geographies where it sees the biggest potential for investments in transition projects to help meet the ﬁrm’s commitments on clean energy investment and emissions reduction. “It’s one of the top three for us at this stage, when we look at the quantum of investment and the range of technologies for energy transition,” he said. Australia “has the right post-code” to be a major player in the decarbonisation of the Asian region which accounts for more than 60 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Its starting point is its abundant solar and wind resources, but the availability of capital and its position as a “stronghold” of human and industrial capabilities to realise complex projects also counts strongly in its favour, he said. Keen on Browse LNG Those attributes explain the huge investments in clean energy BP has on the drawing board in Australia, including the $US36 billion ($56 billion) Asian Renewable Energy Hub  [https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/bp-takes-major-slice-of- us36b-wa-green-hydrogen-hub-20220614-p5atn1]  in the Pilbara region where BP took a stake in June, a renewable diesel and aviation fuel project at its former reﬁnery site in Kwinana and its GERI renewable hydrogen industrial hub at Geraldton.

Bp remains keen also on the proposed $30 billion-plus Browse LNG project – as long as the gas is decarbonised with carbon capture – in recognition of the ongoing need for gas in Japan and South Korea for many years to come, something that was pressed home in bilateral discussions between Australia and Japan in Perth last month. [https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-japan-strengthen-defence-ties-in-face-of- china-threat-20221022-p5bryu] Those projects would come on top of already committed transition investments including large-scale solar through developer Lightsource bp [https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/lightsource-bp-supercharges-solar-growth-20210920- p58t64] , and its electric vehicle charging venture BP Pulse, which opened its ﬁrst charging stations in Australia last month as part of its global target for 100,000 charge points by 2030. “There’s a much broader set of opportunities for industry and investments in order to get to the Nirvana of Paris: clean reliable, affordable energy which will come from energy diversity,” Mr Baudry said. “But in order to get from top three in terms of the funnel of projects to making the investment ... that we think we should be making in this country, then there’s this next step required in policy.” BP is already investing heavily in blue and green hydrogen and offshore wind in the UK, one of its other two regions for transition investments, while the US is the third key area, thanks to the IRA. The group is also “extremely active” in the Middle East, and has a big and growing business in Germany. The IRA, which came into effect in August, includes what experts say are the biggest subsidies for clean hydrogen production in the world, of up to $US3 a kilogram. That results in a cost for clean hydrogen already at $US1.50 a kilogram in the US – which Mr Baudry says is “the most competitive by a very, very large number internationally. Likewise for EVs, tax credits provided for in the legislation has brought the breakeven point for EVs forward from bp’s previous estimate of about 2030 to 2022, he added.', 3: '03/11/2022, 12:32 BP Australia president Frederic Baudry calls for policy to support hydrogen, clean fuels https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/no-policy-no-renewables-powerhouse-says-bp-20221031-p5bu9i 4/5 In contrast, the economics for green hydrogen at BP’s WA projects are “a long way from $US1.50”, while the economics of the sustainable fuels project in Kwinana and CCS for LNG are also “not quite there ... that’s very clear,” Mr Baudry said. “We cannot proceed with investments in energy transition in Australia that are not economic – our investors will not support that.” At the same time, BP as a group will live up to its commitments to invest 40 per cent of its capital investment in transition projects by 2025, and 50 per cent by 2030, he said, while rejecting the suggestion that the upshot may be divestments in Australia if the needed policy drivers do not eventuate. He said huge progress had been made in the last two years in setting the scene in Australia for major investments in transition, including notably the Albanese government’s commitment to 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. The new government also is only four months in and needs time to consider its policy response. “We need to give them a few months and engage in the dialogue to ensure that the policy settings are appropriate for the plurality of investment that we and others want to make,” he said. “Forty-three per cent is great – 2030 is only eight years away. But really, it’s what happens beyond that, and what we put in place now in order to get to something', 4: '03/11/2022, 12:32 BP Australia president Frederic Baudry calls for policy to support hydrogen, clean fuels https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/no-policy-no-renewables-powerhouse-says-bp-20221031-p5bu9i 5/5 which we estimate and others actually, reference is more like 60 per cent by 2035, that the world needs to get to in order to hit the targets of Paris.” Angela Macdonald-Smith  writes on the resources industry with a focus on energy, including gas, oil, electricity and renewables.

Dr Chalmers’ preparedness to embrace direct intervention, which was likened by Santos boss Kevin Gallagher to the antics of the Argentinian government, came as political pressure over energy prices escalated in the wake of Tuesday’s budget. [https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/hard-days-to-come-budget-paves-way-for-tax-hikes- spending-cuts-20221024-p5bscj] The budget forecast electricity prices for this ﬁnancial year would increase by 20 per cent, and by 30 per cent next year, for a total increase of 56 per cent. Growth is forecast to fall to ﬁve per cent the year after. JIm Chalmers in full budget sell mode at the National Press Club. Alex Ellinghausen', 1: '26/10/2022, 10:55 Budget 2022: Treasurer Jim Chalmers open to gas price cap as political pressure builds https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/chalmers-open-to-gas-price-cap-as-political-pressure-builds-20221026-p5bszr 2/4 Gas prices were forecast to rise by 40 per cent for this year and 40 per cent again next year. With the Labor’s election promise to lower average household energy bills by $275 a year by 2025 looking unachievable, and inﬂation and interest rates running rampant, the government was unable to offer cost-of-living assistance in the budget for fear of making inﬂation worse. “I believe that more effective than sending people cheques to deal with it in the near-term, that a better avenue for us to explore is on the regulatory side and, beyond that, I don’t want to limit our options,” he told the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday when pressed on price caps. He also hinted at toughening the voluntary code of conduct which governs how supply contracts are negotiated. Last week, Dr Chalmers and ministerial colleagues Chris Bowen, Madeleine King and Ed Husic began examining options to try to force down prices without creating sovereign risk. It is understood a departmental taskforce has been formed. Australia Workers’ Union National secretary Daniel Walton, who last week proposed ﬁve interventionist options  [https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5br6x] , including having the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission impose price caps on gas, and making the code of conduct enforceable by the ACCC, said the government needed policy in place by January 1. This was amid concerns the government was talking about still having discussions into the next calendar year. “We have to start the conversation immediately, so it comes into effect at the beginning of 2023,” Mr Walton said. “We are the only gas-producing nation in the world, the largest gas producing nation in the world, that does not have a mechanism in place to protect Australia’s interests.” Mr Gallagher slammed the proposals. He said Santos supported measures to guarantee adequate supply of domestic gas through increased monitoring of the gas market by the ACCC.', 2: '26/10/2022, 10:55 Budget 2022: Treasurer Jim Chalmers open to gas price cap as political pressure builds https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/chalmers-open-to-gas-price-cap-as-political-pressure-builds-20221026-p5bszr 3/4 “[But] this increasing regulatory burden and threat of intervention will take Australia rapidly down the Argentinian road, doing nothing to increase supply but plenty to scare off investors and drive prices up as gas supply becomes ever more scarce,” he said. “The only way to support the supply of Australian domestic gas is to let the private sector get on with the job of investing in new gas supply sources like Santos’ [NSW] Narrabri gas project, which is 100 per cent dedicated to the domestic market and desperately needed if the government is serious about reviving Australian manufacturing. “With over 200 years of gas resources at current production rates, Australia can have that competitive energy advantage, but only if the private sector can develop new gas supplies and get them to market with a supportive, stable regulatory and policy environment. “You only have to look at countries like Argentina to see the impacts of market intervention and price controls – they never work, they kill investment so that supply dries up, they send prices through the roof and ultimately, energy and manufacturing have to be propped up with government subsidies that drive government debt to unsustainable levels. These are outcomes that all hurt the most vulnerable people in society.” The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association’s chief executive Samantha McCulloch agreed, saying more supply was the answer. She played down the gas price crisis, saying 90 per cent of gas was sold on long- term contracts while 10 per cent was sold on the volatile spot market. Earlier this month, Resources Minister Madeleine King signed a new heads of agreement with east coast gas exporters  [https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/awu-slams- dud-deal-with-gas-companies-and-calls-for-price-caps-20221012-p5bp2e]  which ensured adequate supply for the domestic market but did nothing to push down price. Dr Chalmers said the plan was to “build on the good work that [Ms] King did in terms of more supply in the market”. He also mentioned toughening the code of conduct which Mr Husic has also called for.', 3: '26/10/2022, 10:55 Budget 2022: Treasurer Jim Chalmers open to gas price cap as political pressure builds https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/chalmers-open-to-gas-price-cap-as-political-pressure-builds-20221026-p5bszr 4/4 “High gas prices are smashing our local industry and making life much harder, as Dan Walton and others have identiﬁed,” he said. “We got more work to do there. “In terms of the type of mechanism, triggers, caps, other kinds of regulation, I’m not prepared to pre-empt any of that or narrow down the conversation today.” Phillip Coorey  is the political editor based in Canberra.

While manufacturers are increasingly adopting hybrid tech as stepping stones to zero-tailpipe-emission products, many are particularly moving away from diesel powertrains. However, Mercedes-Benz says it continues to remain committed to diesel technology in India. 1. Mercedes sedans see majority sales coming from petrol-powered models 2. Target to phase out ICE-powered engines by 2030: Santosh lyer This clearly puts the company in an advantageous position as its arch-rival from Ingolstadt — Audi - had taken a bold move of exiting the segment completely, with the advent of BS VI emission norms in India back in April 2020.', 2: 'According to Santosh lyer, head of marketing and sales at Mercedes-Benz India, “We are fully committed to diesels in our portfolio. We will continue with both powertrains — petrol and diesel — for many years to come.” lyer, who is all set to take over as the managing director and CEO of Mercedes-Benz India from January 1, spoke with our sister publication Autocar Professional on the sidelines of the new GLB and EQB launch in India on December 2. He said the carmaker is confident of conforming to the upcoming (RDE) regulations, and “a lot of our colleagues in engineering and production are very well managing the complexity of the technology.” He mentioned that clean diesels are not environmentally harmful and that diesel engines being globally offered by Mercedes-Benz meet Euro 6 norms in Europe, and are also ready to conform to Euro 7 regulations. “We have the technology to meet these stringent norms and we are confident of our technology. We were the first ones to bring BS VI diesel powertrain in India with the S-Class,” lyer said. “Moreover, from an emissions perspective, while diesels are bad in terms of particulate matter, petrol engines emit higher CO2. Therefore, our focus is on overall sustainability for the entire value chain. For instance, our factory in Pune is presently operating on 100 percent renewable energy, and we are deploying sustainable materials like e-steel in our products,” he added. lyer explained that a country like India has significantly diverse customer requirements and there could be no single technology as the silver bullet. Irrespective of the body type, he says, southern parts of the country see predominantly higher sales of diesel variants, compared to the northern parts where petrol is more prominent. Moreover, SUVs such as the GLC, GLE and GLS see a major chunk (around 70 percent) of their sales coming from diesel engine options. “On the other hand, sedans including the E-Class and S-Class see around 60-70 percent of their volumes coming from petrol,” lyer pointed out. However, following the global trend and the German carmaker’s ambitious plan of going all- electric by 2030 in regions where market conditions allow, lyer said, “We will start introducing EVs in every segment and we will also make a gradual transition towards EVs in the coming future. One-fourth of our overall sales in India will come from EVs over the next four years.” “Both petrol and diesel engines will gradually phase out; globally too, we have a target to phase out internal-combustion engines by 2030, and we are as committed for the Indian market,” he signed off.

"{0: 'Why is carbon an important issue?   Carbon is the term we use at Toyota to refer to carbon dioxide (CO ₂ ) emissions, the main greenhouse gas (GHG) linked to climate change. GHG emissions are caused by activities that generate energy, such as the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to make electricity, and gasoline and diesel to power cars and trucks. These emissions are increasing, driven largely by economic and population growth. GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere trap the sun\'s heat, causing the planet\'s average temperature to rise and leading to large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Global warming and its effects  —  referred to as climate change  —  are being felt in every region around the world in the form of more severe and frequent floods, hurricanes, wildfires and droughts. According to the  latest climate change report issued by the United Nations (UN) , limiting human-induced global warming requires reaching at least net zero CO ₂ emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses are expected to play a significant role in achieving the bold and transformative steps urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. That\'s why Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) named ""Carbon"" as one of our four environmental sustainability focus areas. TMNA\'s Carbon Position Transportation is responsible for one quarter of the world\'s GHG emissions and as an automotive company, TMNA is committed to doing our part to help the world transition to a low carbon economy. TMNA acknowledges climate change as a priority management issue and supports the goals of the Paris Agreement, a pact adopted by 196 countries that commits to reducing GHG emissions in order to keep warming well below 2° Celsius, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. What are we doing to eliminate carbon? Here in North America, our carbon strategy addresses multiple aspects of the vehicle life cycle to find ways to reduce – and eventually eliminate – CO ₂  emissions. Our projects focus on:   Reducing CO ₂  Emissions from New Vehicles Globally, Toyota aims to reduce CO ₂  emissions from new vehicles by 90% by 2050 (from a 2010 baseline).   Zero emissions from our vehicles is the ultimate goal and we believe the path to getting there is with a portfolio approach – fuel cell vehicles, hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and battery electric vehicles. Offering a range of low emission vehicles means we should be able to reduce as much CO2 as possible as soon as possible, which in North America means offering more plug-in hybrids and hybrids until the alternative fueling infrastructure for hydrogen fuel cell and all-electric vehicles expands.   Eliminating CO ₂  Emissions from Our Operations By 2035, Toyota aims to make its manufacturing plants carbon neutral and by 2050, we aim to eliminate CO ₂  emissions from our value chain. We\'re investing in on- and off-site solar and wind projects to lower our carbon footprint. TMNA is a member of the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA), a membership association for large-scale energy buyers seeking to procure renewable energy across the U.S. CEBA’s goals are to catalyze 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy projects by 2025 and to unlock the energy market for all large-scale energy buyers by creating viable pathways to procurement. CARBON Commitment to Carbon Neutrality Carbon  is one of Toyota Motor North America\'s four environmental sustainability focus areas. We are working at every stage of the vehicle life cycle to help the world build a low carbon future.', 1: ""₂ Our logistics, supplier and dealer activities result in upstream and downstream transportation emissions. We collaborate with these business partners to find ways to reduce the carbon footprints of the vehicles we produce. Logistics:  Logistics suppliers make up a significant portion of TMNA’s supply chain CO ₂  emissions. Our logistics network consists of trucking, rail, air and marine carriers, all working in sync to ensure smooth shipping and delivery of vehicles, parts and accessories across North America, from the supplier to the plant, to Toyota’s distribution centers, and ultimately to dealerships and customers. In North America, the majority of TMNA’s freight transport emissions are generated by third-party logistics suppliers. To help mitigate transport-related GHG emissions, TMNA’s internal logistics division works with logistics suppliers to develop GHG reduction strategies. For example, Toyota’s production control logistics group – which procures the parts and materials used to manufacture our vehicles – is working on a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from two primary sources: over-the-road transportation (OTR) and cross dock yard operations. The group’s focus is converting diesel-powered OTR equipment to alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and trialing alternative power systems at cross docks, such as electric shunt trucks. Suppliers: In 2022, we published updated Green Supplier Requirements.

"{0: 'Why is carbon an important issue?   Carbon is the term we use at Toyota to refer to carbon dioxide (CO ₂ ) emissions, the main greenhouse gas (GHG) linked to climate change. GHG emissions are caused by activities that generate energy, such as the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to make electricity, and gasoline and diesel to power cars and trucks. These emissions are increasing, driven largely by economic and population growth. GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere trap the sun\'s heat, causing the planet\'s average temperature to rise and leading to large-scale shifts in weather patterns. Global warming and its effects  —  referred to as climate change  —  are being felt in every region around the world in the form of more severe and frequent floods, hurricanes, wildfires and droughts. According to the  latest climate change report issued by the United Nations (UN) , limiting human-induced global warming requires reaching at least net zero CO ₂ emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses are expected to play a significant role in achieving the bold and transformative steps urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. That\'s why Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) named ""Carbon"" as one of our four environmental sustainability focus areas. TMNA\'s Carbon Position Transportation is responsible for one quarter of the world\'s GHG emissions and as an automotive company, TMNA is committed to doing our part to help the world transition to a low carbon economy. TMNA acknowledges climate change as a priority management issue and supports the goals of the Paris Agreement, a pact adopted by 196 countries that commits to reducing GHG emissions in order to keep warming well below 2° Celsius, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. What are we doing to eliminate carbon? Here in North America, our carbon strategy addresses multiple aspects of the vehicle life cycle to find ways to reduce – and eventually eliminate – CO ₂  emissions. Our projects focus on:   Reducing CO ₂  Emissions from New Vehicles Globally, Toyota aims to reduce CO ₂  emissions from new vehicles by 90% by 2050 (from a 2010 baseline).   Zero emissions from our vehicles is the ultimate goal and we believe the path to getting there is with a portfolio approach – fuel cell vehicles, hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles and battery electric vehicles. Offering a range of low emission vehicles means we should be able to reduce as much CO2 as possible as soon as possible, which in North America means offering more plug-in hybrids and hybrids until the alternative fueling infrastructure for hydrogen fuel cell and all-electric vehicles expands.   Eliminating CO ₂  Emissions from Our Operations By 2035, Toyota aims to make its manufacturing plants carbon neutral and by 2050, we aim to eliminate CO ₂  emissions from our value chain. We\'re investing in on- and off-site solar and wind projects to lower our carbon footprint. TMNA is a member of the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance (CEBA), a membership association for large-scale energy buyers seeking to procure renewable energy across the U.S. CEBA’s goals are to catalyze 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy projects by 2025 and to unlock the energy market for all large-scale energy buyers by creating viable pathways to procurement. CARBON Commitment to Carbon Neutrality Carbon  is one of Toyota Motor North America\'s four environmental sustainability focus areas. We are working at every stage of the vehicle life cycle to help the world build a low carbon future.', 1: ""₂ Our logistics, supplier and dealer activities result in upstream and downstream transportation emissions. We collaborate with these business partners to find ways to reduce the carbon footprints of the vehicles we produce. Logistics:  Logistics suppliers make up a significant portion of TMNA’s supply chain CO ₂  emissions. Our logistics network consists of trucking, rail, air and marine carriers, all working in sync to ensure smooth shipping and delivery of vehicles, parts and accessories across North America, from the supplier to the plant, to Toyota’s distribution centers, and ultimately to dealerships and customers. In North America, the majority of TMNA’s freight transport emissions are generated by third-party logistics suppliers. To help mitigate transport-related GHG emissions, TMNA’s internal logistics division works with logistics suppliers to develop GHG reduction strategies. For example, Toyota’s production control logistics group – which procures the parts and materials used to manufacture our vehicles – is working on a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from two primary sources: over-the-road transportation (OTR) and cross dock yard operations. The group’s focus is converting diesel-powered OTR equipment to alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, and trialing alternative power systems at cross docks, such as electric shunt trucks.

As part of these updated requirements, suppliers are joining us in our efforts to reduce CO ₂  emissions across the vehicle life cycle and are expected to commit to an annual 3% CO ₂  reduction target.

{0: 'NET ZERO TRANSITION PLAN 4   | |   Net Zero Transition Plan 2022 SETTING   THE SCENE STRENGTHENING CONSENSUS   ON GLOBAL CLIMATE SCIENCE   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC)  Sixth Assessment cycle is delivering its starkest warnings yet. In August 2021, its Physical Science Report explained that the  window of opportunity to avoid the worst impacts of climate  change, and prevent warming beyond 1.5°C, is closing. The  2020s was identified as the key decade to keep 1.5°C alive. The Glasgow Pact, the result of COP26 climate negotiations in  November 2021, represents the most stretching commitment  to global carbon reductions yet, however they fall short of  limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Stronger action is needed by governments and business to  support the delivery of net zero. THE CENTRAL ROLE OF THE   POWER SECTOR IN NET ZERO Across climate science, all pathways to net zero emissions  by 2050 globally rely on the accelerated decabonisation of  the power sector as the foundation. Throughout 2021, there  has been a hardening of expectations around the pathway  for electricity system decarbonisation. This special status for net zero electricity is further reinforced by the important social impact it has, in providing power and  heat for homes and businesses. That role is developing to  providing energy for transport too. That means that electricity  affordability and security of supply are vital elements in  delivering a legitimate system transition to net zero. SSE operates principally within the UK and Ireland,  which have stretching climate ambitions, both seeking  to achieve net zero across their economies by 2050. The UK Government’s Net Zero Strategy outlines plans to  decarbonise the UK’s power system by 2035 and Ireland’s  Climate Action Plan 2021 is targeting up to 81% emission  reduction from electricity by 2030. SSE’s ambitions for the  development of renewable energy now extend beyond  the British Isles to carefully selected international markets,  including East Asia, Europe and North America. What is net zero? Net zero refers to the balance between the amount  of greenhouse gas (GHG) produced and the amount  removed from the atmosphere. Net zero is reached  when the amount added is no more than the amount  taken away. To limit global warming to 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels, it is estimated that global GHG  emissions must be net zero by 2050.'}	('supporting_the_need_for_regulations', 'supporting', [0])
"{0: 'Active 82194764.1   1 PUCT PROJECT NO. 53298   WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKET  DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION §   § PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION   OF TEXAS JOINT COMMENTS ON ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED FOR RESOURCE ELIGIBILITY TO PROVIDE FIRM FUEL SUPPLY SERVICE NRG Energy, Inc. (“NRG”), Calpine Corporation (“Calpine”), and Kinder Morgan, Inc. (“KM”), (collectively “Joint Commenters”) appreciate the opportunity to comment on questions posed by Public Utility Commission of Texas ( “PUCT” or “Commission”) staff regarding the Firm Fuel Supply Service (“FFSS”) that the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (“ERCOT”) has proposed to create in nodal protocol revision request (“NPRR”) 1120. Specifically, by this filing, Joint Commenters respond to Commission staff’s Question No. 4: “What attributes should be required for a resource to be eligible to provide FFSS?”  To that end, off-site gas storage capability with firm delivery to a generation resource should be an eligible source of FFSS and included in the procurement of FFSS this fall as part of NPRR 1120. Off-site gas storage capability with firm delivery currently exists throughout the ERCOT region. Joint Commenters believe that there is available off-site gas storage capacity at these existing facilities that generation resources can quickly access, without the time and expense of refurbishing dual fuel capability, constructing onsite storage facilities, or pursuing the necessary environmental permits. Therefore, off-site gas storage with firm delivery is the most cost-effective, readily available, and environmentally feasible way to firm up fuel supply for dispatchable generation resources in ERCOT. Discussions with gas partners such as KM, as well as operational experience with off-site storage deliveries, have led NRG and Calpine to feel confident that they could quickly arrange for additional off-site gas storage capability to increase fuel resiliency in the timeframe proposed by ERCOT for procurement ahead of the 2022-2023 winter. The PUCT and ERCOT intend for FFSS to provide “additional grid reliability and resiliency during extreme cold weather and compensate[] generation resources that meet a higher resiliency standard.” 1   Joint Commenters believe that off-site gas storage with firm delivery to a 1   NPRR 1120 at 1 (Jan. 31, 2022).', 1: 'Active 82194764.1   2 generation resource can achieve that purpose and improve fuel resiliency for resource entities’ natural gas-fired generation, provided it meets the following five criteria. Firm Gas Storage and Withdrawal Contract First, in order for its contracted firm natural gas delivery from off-site storage to qualify as FFSS, the resource entity should be required to have a firm gas storage contract, with gas injection and withdrawal rights for a volume of gas that supports the amount of generation awarded in response to an ERCOT Request for Proposal (“RFP”) for FFSS or offered in support of a bid to provide the FFSS ancillary service. The resource entity would not be required to use the full quantity at all times, but would pay for the storage capacity and withdrawal rights to be available when it nominates a volume of gas up to its maximum daily quantity, thereby making the storage contract “firm.” Firm Gas Transportation Contract Second, the resource entity should be required to have a firm gas transportation contract from the storage facility to the generation resource for the volume of gas that supports the amount of generation awarded in response to the RFP or offered in support of a bid to provide the ancillary service. Weatherized Pipelines and Gas Storage Facilities Third, the eligible gas pipeline and off-site gas storage facilities should be required to be weatherized. Gas pipeline and off-site storage facilities already enjoy a key “weather hardening” feature — they are primarily underground. It is standard industry practices for pipelines to be underground for safety reasons, and off-site gas storage facilities utilize naturally occurring underground caverns and depleted oil and gas wells. Since Winter Storm Uri, pipeline companies have made targeted investments to weather-harden any above-ground gas storage withdrawal facilities, as well as gas compression facilities, based on prior operating experience in cold weather.', 2: ""Active 82194764.1   3 Critical Gas Facilities Designations Fourth, off-site gas storage and the corresponding pipeline facilities should be required to be designated as “Critical Gas Suppliers” and “Critical Customers,” in accordance with Railroad Commission of Texas Rule 3.65. 2   Rule 3.65 works in harmony with the PUCT's substantive rule § 25.52(h) 3  to ensure that critical gas facilities are given priority in the event of any load shed event during an energy emergency. Operators that notify ERCOT of the resource’s status are prioritized during any energy emergency load shed event. In addition, the PUCT has recently prioritized electric service to pipelines that directly provide natural gas to natural gas fired electric generation, underground natural gas transportation and storage facilities, and associated pipelines, compressor stations, and control centers, as Tier 1-A facilities in its guidance to utilities for developing and implementing their emergency power delivery and power restoration plans. 4 Verification Fifth, as part of the response to ERCOT’s RFP for FFSS, the resource entity should be required to provide a sworn affidavit attesting to compliance with these criteria in a manner that supports the amount of capacity of FFSS the generator proposes to offer. The Commission already has the necessary enforcement authority to make this a meaningful attestation. 5   NPRR 1120 also provides for claw back of the Standby Fees, and potential decertification as an FFSS resource for those FFSS resources that fail to come on-line during an FFSS deployment. 6  This provides ERCOT with the means to penalize non-performance. Finally, it is worth noting that forthcoming Railroad Commission reforms will enhance the reliability of gas delivery to electric generation. The Railroad Commission is currently proposing 2   16 Tex. Admin. Code § 3.65 (“TAC”) (defining “Critical Gas Supplier” to include “natural gas pipelines and pipeline facilities including associated compressor stations and control centers” and “underground natural gas  storage facilities,” and “Critical Customer” as “a critical gas supplier for whom the delivery of electricity from an  electric entity is essential to the ability of such gas supplier to operate.”). 3   16 TAC § 25.52(h). 4    Critical Natural Gas Facilities and Entities,  Project No. 52345, Guidance Document for Power Delivery and Restoration During Energy Emergencies (Jan. 14, 2022). 5   A market participant's bids of energy and ancillary services must be “available and capable of performing.” 16 TAC § 25.503(f)(6). A market participant must “submit accurate and factual information” and is prohibited from  submitting “false or misleading information” and from omitting material information in any communication with  ERCOT or the Commission. Id. at § 25.503(f)(8). And the commission’s existing enforcement authority provides a  significant disincentive for a generator to misrepresent the commercial and operational arrangements it has made to  support its proposed offer of FFSS ancillary services. 6  NPRR 1120 at 16-17 (ERCOT Nodal Protocol Section 8.1.1.2.1.7(5)-(9))."", 3: 'Active 82194764.1   4 to amend its Rule 7.455 and repeal its Rule 7.305 in order to elevate  all  gas-fired generation resources (not just generation that serves human needs customers) to the second highest tier of gas curtailment priority. By elevating the priority of firm gas deliveries to electric generation resources, the Railroad Commission’s rule amendments will add a significant reliability backstop to firm gas delivery contracts with electric generation resources, which should give the Commission and ERCOT greater comfort that firm natural gas delivery from off-site storage will be available as a significant portion of the fuel source for the FFSS. Conclusion Natural gas delivery from off-site storage represents the most efficient way to create significant and cost effective FFSS capabilities for Texans, particularly given the abundance of existing off-site natural gas storage and delivery facilities in Texas, the ease with which generation resources have access to the storage and delivery facilities, and the avoided cost of lengthy permitting and retrofitting of existing generation to provide alternative sources of FFSS such as dual fuel and onsite storage. Moreover, the capital improvements to off-site gas storage and delivery facilities incentivized by inclusion in the FFSS would have the ancillary benefit of enhancing the gas deliverability system as a whole, including non-FFSS generators and local gas delivery companies. These capabilities would support reliability across the energy delivery chain, lessening the toll of future weather-induced emergencies. Accordingly, Joint Commenters respectfully request that generation resources with contracts for firm off-site natural gas storage with firm delivery service qualify to provide FFSS.

We have clear plans and concrete projects to reduce our sector’s CO 2  emissions by at least 55  percent by 2030 and to achieve climate-neutral steel production in the European Union by 2050. These  commitments represent a truly industrial revolution that requires a massive €30 billion capital investment in  breakthrough technologies over the coming eight years and a significant increase in operational costs  stemming from the use of decarbonized electricity and hydrogen. However, European legislators are now considering proposals on the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) and  the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that undermine our capacity to invest in these projects and  derail the transition to green steel production in Europe. The proposals weaken carbon leakage protection of our industry in the domestic and global markets, favouring  international competitors which are not subject to equivalent carbon costs. In Europe, new allocation rules will  suddenly reduce the main CO 2  benchmark by around 40 percent – because of one plant that was previously  not in the scope – and set a value which no company can achieve in just three years. This is due to a premature  transition from the free allocation and indirect cost compensation system to a CBAM which has not yet been  tested. Circumvention and resource shuffling are only a few of the many risks that could undermine the CBAM’s  effectiveness. Moreover, the CBAM does not yet foresee any measure to preserve the EU’s 20 million tonnes  of steel exports per year, worth €45 billion, and the 30,000 jobs that are directly dependent on these. The proposals also remove massive allowances from the market, further driving the carbon and electricity price  in Europe at a time when businesses and households are struggling with skyrocketing energy costs and  inflation. Finally, they fail to capture the much higher carbon footprint of stainless steel imports derived from  the embedded alloying elements. We call on the European Parliament and Council to immediately address these concerns and in particular to: •   Avoid further scaling back existing carbon leakage protection until the CBAM has proven its effectiveness  and a solution for exports is in place; •   Prevent a sharp decrease in free allocation for existing steel plants which would result from a modification  of the benchmark scope. Instead, low carbon technologies must be rewarded without reducing  prematurely benchmark values, at least in the first years when such technologies are introduced at an  industrial scale. The aforementioned changes to the ETS and CBAM will allow us to make the green steel transformation happen  now within the EU. Our investments will greatly benefit climate protection, the EU’s industrial competitiveness,  and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the EU.

Moreover, the CBAM does not yet foresee any measure to preserve the EU’s 20 million tonnes  of steel exports per year, worth €45 billion, and the 30,000 jobs that are directly dependent on these. The proposals also remove massive allowances from the market, further driving the carbon and electricity price  in Europe at a time when businesses and households are struggling with skyrocketing energy costs and  inflation. Finally, they fail to capture the much higher carbon footprint of stainless steel imports derived from  the embedded alloying elements. We call on the European Parliament and Council to immediately address these concerns and in particular to: •   Avoid further scaling back existing carbon leakage protection until the CBAM has proven its effectiveness  and a solution for exports is in place; •   Prevent a sharp decrease in free allocation for existing steel plants which would result from a modification  of the benchmark scope. Instead, low carbon technologies must be rewarded without reducing  prematurely benchmark values, at least in the first years when such technologies are introduced at an  industrial scale. The aforementioned changes to the ETS and CBAM will allow us to make the green steel transformation happen  now within the EU. Our investments will greatly benefit climate protection, the EU’s industrial competitiveness,  and hundreds of thousands of jobs across the EU.

We have clear plans and concrete projects to reduce our sector’s CO 2  emissions by at least 55  percent by 2030 and to achieve climate-neutral steel production in the European Union by 2050. These  commitments represent a truly industrial revolution that requires a massive €30 billion capital investment in  breakthrough technologies over the coming eight years and a significant increase in operational costs  stemming from the use of decarbonized electricity and hydrogen. However, European legislators are now considering proposals on the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) and  the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that undermine our capacity to invest in these projects and  derail the transition to green steel production in Europe. The proposals weaken carbon leakage protection of our industry in the domestic and global markets, favouring  international competitors which are not subject to equivalent carbon costs. In Europe, new allocation rules will  suddenly reduce the main CO 2  benchmark by around 40 percent – because of one plant that was previously  not in the scope – and set a value which no company can achieve in just three years. This is due to a premature  transition from the free allocation and indirect cost compensation system to a CBAM which has not yet been  tested. Circumvention and resource shuffling are only a few of the many risks that could undermine the CBAM’s  effectiveness. Moreover, the CBAM does not yet foresee any measure to preserve the EU’s 20 million tonnes  of steel exports per year, worth €45 billion, and the 30,000 jobs that are directly dependent on these.

{0: '         1 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs FORTUM VIEWS ON THE PROPOSAL FOR THE REVISION OF THE ENERGY PERFORMANCE OF THE  BUILDINGS DIRECTIVE (‘EPBD’ RECAST) 15/12/2021 1. PREFACE Fortum welcomes the recast proposal for the EPBD which targets to align the contribution from the  buildings sector with the overall FF55 targets. The objectives of the EPBD recast proposal are summarized as follows: •   Reducing buildings’ GHG emissions and final energy consumption by 2030 and •   Setting a long-term vision for buildings towards EU-wide climate neutrality in 2050. In order to meet them, the initiative is grounded in several specific objectives: •   To increase the rate and depth of buildings renovations, •   To improve information on energy performance and sustainability of buildings, and •   To ensure that all buildings will be in line with the 2050 climate neutrality requirements. Strengthened financial support, modernization and system integration are levers to deliver on these  objectives. It is also notable that the Regulatory Scrutiny Board has notified that the impact  assessment of the EPBD proposal was considered insufficient for the achievement of 2030 climate  hence the considerations for the recast should be carefully done bearing in mind the proportionality  and effectiveness of proposed and later on decided new measures. We are to a certain extend concerned about the additional and relatively tight new regulatory and  administrative burdens that the EPBD recast would cause mainly for the building owners but also for  the heat suppliers when the new target of zero-emission buildings will relatively soon replace the  current requirements for the nearly-zero emission buildings. The fit-for-purpose (proportionality)  and cost effectiveness of the proposed measures are not self-evident. Instead the main barrier might  remain be the access to external public and private financing and the profitability of investments in  buildings in competition with many other alternative public and private expenditures. The contributions from the efficient DHC systems as defined by the recast proposal of EED are well- recognized and should even more explicitly be kept in parity with on-site heating and cooling. Overall,  the coherence of EPBD across EED and RED3 recasts can be improved and more explicitly verified  (for example under Article 2 Definitions). We would underline to recognize and more explicitly verify across the whole EPBD recast the  principles of •   Technology neutrality and •   Parity between on-site and nearby heat and cool solutions where efficient DHC – as defined  by EED - is the most scalable and climate benign nearby energy solution.', 1: '         2 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs The de-carbonization and energy efficiency measures in the heating and cooling sector must go hand- in-hand with the de-carbonization of the buildings sector, and district heating and cooling (DHC)  systems have a key scalable, economic and efficient role to play e.g. by converting to renewable  energy sources and waste heat and cold, and to high-efficient CHP. We consider that the EPBD recast should primarily focus on its objectives and less on its concrete  measures which should be mostly determined at national level hence the national circumstances  differ substantially. Further, more focus could be put on the integration between the buildings and  the whole energy systems (electricity, gas and heating & cooling). 2. PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION Fortum proposes that the following amendments should be considered. Article 2. Definitions The EPBD definitions should be in full and clear coherence with RED3 and EED recasts . Overall, an  explicit link of various EPBD provisions/definitions with EED recast article 24 concerning efficient  district heating and cooling systems should be clearly verified within EPBD recast. •   The definition of 2:2 ZEB and related Annex I should explicitly be linked with the efficient district  heating and cooling (‘DHC’) systems as defined by EED recast articles 2 and 24; •   The definition of 2:3 NZEB should explicitly and consistently with the above ZEB definition be  linking the term ‘nearby’ energy with the definition of efficient DHC as defined by EED recast  articles 2 and 24; •   The EPBD definition of 2:13 ‘renewable energy sources’ should be directly linked with RED3  recast article 2:1; •   The definition of 2:49 ‘energy from renewable energy sources produced nearby’ should explicitly  include the efficient DHC systems defined by the EED recast; •   The definition of ‘efficient district heating and cooling’ – as reference to EED recast articles 2 and  24 should be added; •   The definitions of ‘biomass’ and ‘waste heat and cold’ – as reference to RED3 recast articles 2:24  and 2:9 should be added. Article 3. National building renovation plans The heating and cooling suppliers are among the key stakeholders for the de-carbonization of the  buildings sector. This article should clearly include them as part of the mandatory public consultation  for the national building renovation plan introduced and required by this article. •   The preparations and related consultation of the national building renovation plans should be  largely synchronized (e.g. target- and timeline wise) with the requirements for the national  comprehensive assessments (CAs) under EED article 23 hence the ultimate objective of both  obligations is to de-carbonize and make more energy efficient the national building stocks;', 2: '         3 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs •   Under paragraph 3 it should be added that “the public consultation shall involve in particular  local and regional authorities,  representatives of heating and cooling suppliers  and other socio- economic partners, including …”. Article 4. Adoption of a methodology for calculating the energy performance of buildings Member States shall apply a methodology for calculation energy performance of buildings with the  common general framework as set out in Annex I. We suggest to clarify that the adoption of this  principle can be done also at local level when it would mean that DHC system specific (and forward- looking approach) for the EPC could be used. •   To amend the text as follows: ‘That methodology can be adopted at national, regional  or  local  level’. Article 10. Building renovation passports (RPs) The requirements for buildings’ RPs should include data on the share of renewable energy in the  energy mix of the building (including on-site and nearby energy). The proposed recommendations  on potential future solutions to decrease emissions from heating and cooling supply, should also  cover the potential to switch to an efficient DHC system. •   Paragraph 3 to include a new sub-paragraph: (e) it shall include data on the share of renewable  energies in the energy mix of the building (produced and delivered both on-site as well as  through district heating networks), as well as recommendations on potential future works to  decrease heating and cooling emissions, including the potential connection to an efficient district  heating network. Further, we would like the Commission to identify and present if there exists any best-practice  precedence from already having a deployed and result-delivered national concept of renovation  passports in place. Alternatively, In the case if there does not exist any recommendable and scalable  national precedence, we would suggest some caution in bringing this concept forwards and to  reconsider the proposed time line for the implementation. The proposed time line to have a common  European framework by end of 2023 and for member States to have their national frameworks ready  for implementation by end of 2024 may – depending on the available precedence – be regarded as  overly ambitious or even unrealistic. Article 14. Data exchange We regard it positive that key stakeholders of the buildings would be granted with the direct access  to their building systems’ data without any additional costs. However, providing such data could be  quite cost intensive for energy suppliers, therefore this issue should be more explicitly addressed. The proposal should make a clear distinction between raw and processed data. For example,  providing raw data is feasible for DHC suppliers at reasonable costs, as those data are already  available and are, in most cases, already shared with customers. Furthermore, providing processed  data would have a substantial impact in terms of time and costs that not all data providers would not  be able to grant.', 3: '         4 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs The Member States should be allowed some flexibility to define the details for the data that is  considered free of charge because the solutions for heat and cold supply vary substantially across  Member States. Those other additional costs charged should be based on the matching (causing)  principle and be reasonable. •   For the purpose of this Directive, building systems data shall include at least all data related to  the energy performance of building elements, the energy performance of building services,  building automation and control systems, meters and charging points for e-mobility. There  should be added to the end:  “Both processed and non-processed data will be accepted under  the scope of this article, as long as they meet these requirements. The details of the coverage  of the free-of-charge data will be defined by the Member States.” Article 16. Energy performance certificates (EPC) We are in principle supportive to the concept of energy performance certificates (EPCs) since they  are the key indicators to guarantee a comprehensive overview of buildings’ energy performance. However, the Commission and the Member States should put extraordinary focus on the elements  that help the constructors and the building owners to utilize such information and to steer their  decision making in a technology neutral manner. Given the huge differences between building types and energy prices and consumption to heat the  households in the different Member States, there exists an obvious risk of incomparability at EU  level. Some countries could be unfairly penalized by the requirement to categorize into the EPC class  G the worst performing buildings, as these might be included under a better category in other  Member States. The EPBD should further clarify within this article the principle that equal heat and cooling  solutions (on-site vs. nearby) causing comparable (low carbon) primary energy footprints should  always be in a full parity when defining the EPC classification. The primary objective should be to  make this comparison in accordance with local conditions and preferably having the possibility to  base EPC on forward-looking assessment instead of historical data. This would encourage the heat  and cold suppliers prepare longer-term plans for de-carbonization and energy efficiency. Annex I. Common general framework for the calculation of energy performance of buildings  (related to article 4) The methodology to calculate primary energy should explicitly include the possibility to use the  primary energy factors (PEFs)  or alternatively the use of nationally determined weighting factors  (WFs) . The proposed text of the recast EPBD between paragraphs 3 and 4 is currently inconsistent. The weighting factors should be added to the paragraph 3. In both cases, they should be determined  by the Member States. •   Point 1 last paragraph: “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where  buildings are supplied by district heating or cooling systems, the benefits of such supply are', 4: '         5 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs recognized and accounted for in the calculation methodology through individually certified or  recognized primary energy factors  or weighting factors .” •   Point 2 paragraph 3: “The calculation of primary energy shall be based on primary energy factors,  (distinguishing non-renewable, renewable and total)  or weighting factors  per energy carrier,  which have to be recognized by the national authorities. Those primary energy factors may be  based on national, regional or local information. Primary energy factors  and weighting factors   may be set on an annual, seasonal, monthly, daily or hourly basis or on more specific information  made available for individual district  heating and cooling  systems.” Annex III. Requirements for new and renovated zero-emission buildings and calculation of life- cycle global warming potential (GWP)  (related to articles 2 and 7) We consider that the categoric ZEB limits that have been proposed to follow climate zones is rather  unpractical and unrealistically too general. We propose to remove the table 1. Both the ZEB and  NZEB criteria should be determined and justified at national level. Further, the scope of  implementation e.g. the specification of referred floor area should be included in order to secure  sufficient comparability across the Member States. The reference to efficient district heating and cooling should explicitly be referred to the EED recast  proposal article 24. The proposed text is confusing and incoherent. We suggest deleting renewable  energy and waste heat and simply refer to heat from an efficient DHC system as more explicitly to  be defined by EED recast article 24. •   Point 1 paragraph 2 sub-bullet 3 to be amended: “– renewable energy and waste heat  heat  from  an efficient district heating and cooling system in accordance with Article (24(1) of Directive (EU)  …/… [recast EED].” More information: Fortum Oyj  (EU Transparency Register ID 03501997362-71) Harri-Pekka Korhonen, Head of Heat Policies and Regulation Phone +358 50 452 9321      harri.korhonen@fortum.com'}	('energy_transition_&_zero_carbon_technologies', 'not_supporting', [0, 1])

Further, we would like the Commission to identify and present if there exists any best-practice  precedence from already having a deployed and result-delivered national concept of renovation  passports in place. Alternatively, In the case if there does not exist any recommendable and scalable  national precedence, we would suggest some caution in bringing this concept forwards and to  reconsider the proposed time line for the implementation. The proposed time line to have a common  European framework by end of 2023 and for member States to have their national frameworks ready  for implementation by end of 2024 may – depending on the available precedence – be regarded as  overly ambitious or even unrealistic. Article 14. Data exchange We regard it positive that key stakeholders of the buildings would be granted with the direct access  to their building systems’ data without any additional costs. However, providing such data could be  quite cost intensive for energy suppliers, therefore this issue should be more explicitly addressed. The proposal should make a clear distinction between raw and processed data. For example,  providing raw data is feasible for DHC suppliers at reasonable costs, as those data are already  available and are, in most cases, already shared with customers. Furthermore, providing processed  data would have a substantial impact in terms of time and costs that not all data providers would not  be able to grant.', 3: '         4 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs The Member States should be allowed some flexibility to define the details for the data that is  considered free of charge because the solutions for heat and cold supply vary substantially across  Member States. Those other additional costs charged should be based on the matching (causing)  principle and be reasonable. •   For the purpose of this Directive, building systems data shall include at least all data related to  the energy performance of building elements, the energy performance of building services,  building automation and control systems, meters and charging points for e-mobility. There  should be added to the end:  “Both processed and non-processed data will be accepted under  the scope of this article, as long as they meet these requirements. The details of the coverage  of the free-of-charge data will be defined by the Member States.” Article 16. Energy performance certificates (EPC) We are in principle supportive to the concept of energy performance certificates (EPCs) since they  are the key indicators to guarantee a comprehensive overview of buildings’ energy performance. However, the Commission and the Member States should put extraordinary focus on the elements  that help the constructors and the building owners to utilize such information and to steer their  decision making in a technology neutral manner. Given the huge differences between building types and energy prices and consumption to heat the  households in the different Member States, there exists an obvious risk of incomparability at EU  level. Some countries could be unfairly penalized by the requirement to categorize into the EPC class  G the worst performing buildings, as these might be included under a better category in other  Member States. The EPBD should further clarify within this article the principle that equal heat and cooling  solutions (on-site vs. nearby) causing comparable (low carbon) primary energy footprints should  always be in a full parity when defining the EPC classification. The primary objective should be to  make this comparison in accordance with local conditions and preferably having the possibility to  base EPC on forward-looking assessment instead of historical data. This would encourage the heat  and cold suppliers prepare longer-term plans for de-carbonization and energy efficiency. Annex I. Common general framework for the calculation of energy performance of buildings  (related to article 4) The methodology to calculate primary energy should explicitly include the possibility to use the  primary energy factors (PEFs)  or alternatively the use of nationally determined weighting factors  (WFs) . The proposed text of the recast EPBD between paragraphs 3 and 4 is currently inconsistent. The weighting factors should be added to the paragraph 3. In both cases, they should be determined  by the Member States. •   Point 1 last paragraph: “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where  buildings are supplied by district heating or cooling systems, the benefits of such supply are', 4: '         5 (5)     30 th  March 2022 Fortum Oyj / Corporate Public Affairs recognized and accounted for in the calculation methodology through individually certified or  recognized primary energy factors  or weighting factors .” •   Point 2 paragraph 3: “The calculation of primary energy shall be based on primary energy factors,  (distinguishing non-renewable, renewable and total)  or weighting factors  per energy carrier,  which have to be recognized by the national authorities. Those primary energy factors may be  based on national, regional or local information. Primary energy factors  and weighting factors   may be set on an annual, seasonal, monthly, daily or hourly basis or on more specific information  made available for individual district  heating and cooling  systems.” Annex III. Requirements for new and renovated zero-emission buildings and calculation of life- cycle global warming potential (GWP)  (related to articles 2 and 7) We consider that the categoric ZEB limits that have been proposed to follow climate zones is rather  unpractical and unrealistically too general. We propose to remove the table 1. Both the ZEB and  NZEB criteria should be determined and justified at national level. Further, the scope of  implementation e.g. the specification of referred floor area should be included in order to secure  sufficient comparability across the Member States. The reference to efficient district heating and cooling should explicitly be referred to the EED recast  proposal article 24. The proposed text is confusing and incoherent. We suggest deleting renewable  energy and waste heat and simply refer to heat from an efficient DHC system as more explicitly to  be defined by EED recast article 24. •   Point 1 paragraph 2 sub-bullet 3 to be amended: “– renewable energy and waste heat  heat  from  an efficient district heating and cooling system in accordance with Article (24(1) of Directive (EU)  …/… [recast EED].” More information: Fortum Oyj  (EU Transparency Register ID 03501997362-71) Harri-Pekka Korhonen, Head of Heat Policies and Regulation Phone +358 50 452 9321      harri.korhonen@fortum.com'}	('energy_and_resource_efficiency', 'not_supporting', [0, 1])
"{0: '1992 3 e II 3 s Monsieur Emmanuel Macron Président de la République Palais de I‘Elysée 55 rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré 75008 Paris Munchen / Paris, 30th September 2022 Franco-German Evian call Dear President Macron We would like to thank you very much for your participation in the 30"" Evian Franco-German Business Meeting. In these uncertain times, your presence — as well as Chancellor Scholz’s — was a tremendously important signal to the Business Community. All participants are joining us to express how much we appreciated these open and frank dialogues with both leaders of our countries. France and Germany share indeed not only an exemplary friendship, but a unique responsibility towards our continent and the future of European integration. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Europe have been at the heart of this 2022 Evian Franco-German business meeting. We, the group of 40 entrepreneurs from France and Germany, are dedicated to making Europe stronger and promoting its political priorities as well as its social and economic interests. We therefore support all political efforts to ensure Europe’s sovereignty, resilience, and competitiveness. One fact we all understood during the last crises is that our supply chains are not resilient enough and that we are too dependent on certain markets and suppliers. Businesses have the responsibility to diversify their supply chains. But our answer cannot be nationalization or decoupling from the rest of the world. Europe has always thrived on cooperation and global trade. And going forward, too, we must be a role model for a more resilient version of globalization and global collaboration. The war in Ukraine has also been contributing to high inflation, in particular through a huge rise of energy prices, challenging the business model of many European industries. The risk of recession is looming in Europe. To limit the risk of social unrest, we as business leaders will double up our efforts to protect and develop high value jobs. The more competitive Europe remains, especially in the energy domain, the more successful our efforts will be. The current situation shows how important it is that European States develop joint energy policies — policies promoting security of supply, sustainability, and affordability for all consumers in Europe. Indeed, the affordability of energy is key for the future competitiveness of our industries, particularly for energy-intensive ones such as the chemical industry, cement', 1: 'works, steelworks or car makers and their ecosystems, but also for many SMEs! for which energy costs represent an unexpected new burden. Considering the current short-term dislocations of the gas and electricity markets, governments should take urgent actions to protect our industries and SMEs. To achieve the most efficient energy system for Europe, meaning the most reliable and affordable one, it is clear to us that an integrated European system will be much more efficient than 27 energy systems we currently have in the EU member states, which are united only through the interconnections at the European level. We hence call for a European Energy Union that has the power to strengthen the sovereignty of Europe and address the various energy dimensions. In particular, for a joint and successful energy policy (as well as Europe’s great goal to reach net zero carbon emissions), modern and efficient electricity grids are critical. It is clear to us that European governments should urgently launch massive investment programs in these grids, both at national and European levels. They will be the essential backbone of our decarbonized future. In all fields mentioned in this letter, it will be essential to increase the speed of execution. We believe that this acceleration will require much faster strategic alignment across European countries and a simplification of bureaucracy wherever possible. The Evian 2022 participants are ready to do their fair share and contribute to this important work. Dear President, we are at an inflection point. Not just in Europe, but in the whole world. We count on your leadership — and the joint leadership of France and Germany — to re-define Europe’s path into the future. On behalf of the participants of Evian 2022.

The partnership centres on driving forward the production of carbon-neutral steel, with a plan to replace coal with wind power and green hydrogen as the main source of energy in steel production at ArcelorMittal’s steelmaking sites in Germany. To decarbonise its production sites in Bremen, Hamburg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Duisburg as planned, ArcelorMittal Germany needs renewable energy on a large scale. RWE and ArcelorMittal are assessing options for joint participation in tenders for o�shore wind farm sites in the North Sea. The amendment of the ""Wind Energy at Sea Act"" (WindSeeG) currently under way is crucial for success, as it will permanently shape the cost structure in the German o�shore wind sector. If the law were to establish ""negative bids"" in o�shore wind tenders, �nancing wind farms would be more challenging and send the wrong pricing signals to the market by making wind power unnecessarily expensive. Competitive electricity prices are absolutely necessary, if energy-intensive industries such as the steel industry, which operates in a competitive global environment, are to have a future in Germany. RWE and ArcelorMittal strongly believe that with the right steer, green steel from Germany can become a benchmark worldwide for low-carbon emissions steel production. RWE and ArcelorMittal also want to work together on the development of green hydrogen, by jointly looking for areas where electrolysis plants can be built to supply the steel production sites in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, starting with a 70 MW pilot plant by 2026 with the clear intention to increase to Gigawatt-scale projects in the long term - subject to approval of public funding. With the combination of RWE’s expertise in o�shore wind farms and electrolysers, and ArcelorMittal as a guaranteed buyer of the green electricity and hydrogen, the two companies believe they have excellent opportunities for a viable partnership arrangement. RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to conclude long-term purchase agreements for both wind power and green hydrogen. Sven Utermöhlen, CEO O�shore Wind, RWE Renewables:  “Electricity from renewable energies and green hydrogen must become the hallmark of industrial production in Germany. Industry needs both in large quantities as soon as possible in order to achieve its climate targets. That is why we are planning one of the most ambitious expansion projects for o�shore wind farms and electrolysers in Germany, together with ArcelorMittal. If the regulatory framework is right, we want to be successful together in the bidding for o�shore areas. ArcelorMittal is an excellent partner to expand our industry cooperation and thus give real impetus to decarbonisation projects in Germany.” Reiner Blaschek, CEO ArcelorMittal Germany, comments:  “ArcelorMittal Germany is embarking on a radical transition to ensure we reach our CO  emissions reduction targets, meaning that the energy used to make steel will need to be clean energy. The partnership we have announced with RWE today is signi�cant for a number of reasons: it will provide us with the renewable, a�ordable electricity and green hydrogen that we need to produce low-emissions steel while remaining competitive in a global market. It also o�ers vital security in the supply chain, by integrating the supply of energy and hydrogen into our business. We are looking forward to working with RWE on this highly important project and bene�ting from their experience and know-how, as we continue to lead the industry in the decarbonisation of steelmaking in Germany and beyond.” 2 \ue997 \ue995', 2: ""27/06/2022, 12:33 RWE and ArcelorMittal intend to jointly build and operate offshore wind farms and hydrogen facilities, for low-emissions stee… https://www.rwe.com/en/press/rwe-ag/2022-06-22-rwe-and-arcelormittal-mou-to-build-and-operate-offshore-wind-farms-and-hydrogen-facilities 3/5 Downloads As the world’s leading steel producer, ArcelorMittal has ambitious climate action goals, including a target to reduce CO  emissions by 35% by 2030 in Europe, and a group-wide target to be carbon neutral by 2050. By 2030, ArcelorMittal is aiming to exceed this target in Germany, by moving away from coal-intensive blast furnace technology to electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and direct reduction (DRI) plants. They also plan to gradually replace natural gas with green hydrogen as the fuel for these facilities, once it is cost-competitive at scale. In addition to the partnership on renewable electricity and green hydrogen, the companies want to investigate possible uses for ArcelorMittal’s low-emissions steel in components for RWE's renewable electricity plants. RWE wants to be climate-neutral by 2040. To achieve this goal, the energy company needs to decarbonise its supply chain, and the use of low-emissions steel will make an important contribution to this. 2 Olaf Winter Conventional generation / Renewables T +49 (0) 201 5179-8455 RWE and BOURBON enter partnership to jointly bid for French \ue997 \ue995""}"	('energy_transition_&_zero_carbon_technologies', 'supporting', [1])

PACCAR also designs and manufactures advanced diesel engines, provides financial services, information technology, and distributes truck parts related to its principal business. PACCAR appreciates the opportunity to comment on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA” or the “Agency”) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM” or “Proposed Rule”) to establish next-tier low-NO x  emission standards and other related requirements for new heavy-duty on-highway (“HDOH"") engines and vehicles. See  87 Fed. Reg. 17414 (March 28, 2022). I. INTRODUCTION In addition to our comments, PACCAR also endorses the comments filed by the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association (“EMA”). See  Comments of the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association on Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2019-0055 (May 13, 2022)', 1: '2 (hereinafter “EMA Comments”). In particular, PACCAR agrees with the following aspects of EMA’s comments: i. The feasibility of centering a program around a 0.02 g/bhp-hr FTP/RMC NO x  standard  (as opposed to a core standard set at or above Option 2-like levels) has not been,  and cannot be, established. ii. EPA has not sufficiently validated the new proposed in-use low-NO x  standards and  “3B-MAW” testing protocols, particularly those associated with “Bin 3.” iii. EPA’s proposed in-use low-NO x  standards need to properly account for the capabilities  of in-use emission-measurement and data-processing systems. iv. The low-NO x  regulations, if centered around a 0.02g/bhp-hr standard, could result in  decreased fuel-efficiency, which could threaten the feasibility and implementation of  the HDOH Phase 2 GHG standards, especially the 2027 MY standards, which should  not be revised. v. The proposed extended useful life (UL), and durability demonstration testing  requirements, coupled with the increased recall liability, could result in manufacturers  building-in assumptions regarding the need to replace the aftertreatment systems at  approximately 500,000 miles (or sooner), which would cause substantial price  increases for new HDOH vehicles. vi. The increase in manufacturers’ costs to cover the proposed extended warranty  requirements will be substantial, and necessarily will be passed on to purchasers at  the point of sale. vii. A nationwide program centered around Option 2-like requirements, and including  higher interim in-use standards, would be more cost-effective, and would reduce the  prospects for further delaying fleet turnover or creating disruptive pre-buy/no-buy  responses from the market. viii. The low-NO x  regulations, if centered around Option 1, would have costs that exceed  monetized benefits by a significant margin, as demonstrated through independent  expert analyses prepared by Ricardo, NERA Economic Consulting, ACT Research  Group, and NREL. PACCAR is pleased that EPA included two options in the Proposed Rule and supports a stringent, but implementable, single step low-NO x  standard in MY 2027. The data and supporting information provided herein will demonstrate that Option 2 with certain', 2: '3 flexibilities, and features of Option 1, represent a reasonable, technically-feasible regulation. By contrast, Option 1 on its own is technically infeasible. PACCAR supports many aspects of EPA’s Proposed Rule. For example, PACCAR supports EPA’s objective to control emissions over a wider range of real-world operation by proposing new regulatory elements such as the low load cycle and an improved in-use compliance program including deterioration factor (“DF”) verification. PACCAR also supports the Agency’s proposal to extend the UL to maintain emissions performance, while at the same time providing flexibilities to meet the proposed lower emission standards. PACCAR is committed to ultimately moving toward a zero emission future to help reduce the carbon footprint associated with U.S. commerce, and we believe that a GHG Phase 3 rule will help achieve this goal. PACCAR supports the GHG Phase 3 rulemaking and other rulemakings that provide regulatory certainty and facilitate product planning. However, PACCAR does not support re-opening the GHG Phase 2 rule, specifically with respect to the standards set to take effect in MY 2027. PACCAR has relied on the certainty of the Phase 2 rule’s progressively more stringent GHG standards to design our Zero-Emission Vehicles (“ZEVs”) and accelerate their deployment. EPA sought to incentivize that accelerated deployment of ZEV trucks by providing enhanced emission credits, and EPA should not reopen the Phase 2 rule to change the ZEV credit framework simply because the incentives worked. PACCAR therefore supports the single step low-NO x  standard in MY 2027 that would enable OEMs to comply with the next generation of compression ignition engine NO x  standards, while at the same time focusing on ensuring a zero emission future for 2030 and beyond.', 3: '4 II. OVERARCHING COMMENTS ON PROPOSED REGULATORY TOPICS The sections below address the following areas of the Proposed Rule: Feasibility of Criteria Pollutant Emission Standards; Useful Life; Feasibility of In-Use Emission Standards; Warranty and Allowable Maintenance; and Average, Banking and Trading Program. A. Criteria Pollutant Emission Standards 1. Feasibility of Standards PACCAR agrees with EMA’s assessment that the proposed standards are technically infeasible and incorporates below certain aspects of EMA’s comments, sometimes verbatim, in addition to providing our own comments. CARB’s recently promulgated Heavy-Duty Omnibus low-NO x  Regulation aims to reduce NO x  emission standards by 90% compared to the current 2010 emission standards and prescribes a 50% reduction in the PM mass standard. This aggressive action seeks to reduce the last one to two percent of HDOH NO x  engine emissions. EPA’s proposed “Option 1” mirrors the CARB Omnibus requirements in nearly every respect, including the proposed 0.020 g/bhp-hr NO x  certification standard for MY 2031. However, the a 90% NO x  reduction, coupled with the proposed new “low-load” certification cycle and a completely new in-use emissions testing and compliance protocol (with barely measurable NO x  limits), presents an inherently infeasible technical challenge for HDOH diesel engines. The Southwest Research Institute’s (“SwRI’s”) system is the principal basis for the purported feasibility of the 0.020 g/bhp-hr NO x  standard. CARB’s assertion that the new low-NO x  requirements are technically feasible is based on a system demonstrated by SwRI over accelerated laboratory aging. To support its low-NO x  rulemaking, EPA also contracted', 4: '5 with SwRI to perform an aged emissions demonstration with a technical solution very similar to the CARB “Stage 3” technology package. PACCAR concurs with EMA – which has been engaging with EPA and CARB on HDOH low-NO x  rulemakings from the outset, including on the underlying SwRI demonstration projects – that the Omnibus/Option 1 low-NO x  standards have  not  been demonstrated to be technically feasible, and are in fact infeasible, for the following reasons: a. The aged-engine “Stage 3” NO x  emissions results neither meet the proposed future 0.020 g/bhp-hr NO x  standard across all required certification cycles, nor consistently meet the in-use NO x  standards when laboratory tested on “road cycles” that mimic real-world operation, which shows that the SwRI program was a demonstration of technical infeasibility. CARB and EPA have not considered real-world conditions and other factors that increase NO x emissions, or the accelerated aftertreatment deterioration that will occur in the field. Those real-world conditions and other factors, which were not “in scope” in the SwRI demonstration program, will require significant additional development effort, and likely additional NO x  and CO 2  emissions control hardware. “Getting close” to meeting extremely stringent emissions requirements, as SwRI did, is inadequate and an unreasonable basis for setting the Option 1 emissions standards at issue, especially when the agencies have not considered critical and significant emissions-increasing factors. b. “Packaging” requirements (i.e., fitting emission systems under the hood or cab) to “close-couple” the new light-off SCR (“LO-SCR”) to the turbocharger turbine exit will be extremely difficult, and/or will require cab retooling. Such retooling costs are expensive (on the order of $500 million) for low-volume', 5: '6 products with potentially abbreviated amortization schedules, especially as those same vehicles transition to battery-electric and other “zero-emissions” technologies driven, at least in part, by other regulations. Diesel engine manufacturers often use the term “margin” when talking about the headroom they must design into their emissions control strategies. Margin is the difference between the underlying emissions standard and the lower “as-designed” emissions performance that diesel engine manufacturers target for their products. Manufacturers must design and calibrate to provide for sufficient margin to ensure robust compliance after accounting for the myriad factors that can compromise real-world emissions performance, thereby protecting themselves from recall and/or enforcement actions, fines, damaged reputations, etc. With this background, PACCAR explains its additional concerns regarding the demonstration testing and its inability to represent real-world, in-commerce applications: \uf0b7 The demonstration testing on which EPA relies was conducted on a single engine with the calibration adjusted multiple times to perform in an optimal manner for a specific engine. \uf0b7 Manufacturers must meet the proposed emission limits on tens of thousands of engines per year. These engines are mass-produced and have an inherent spread in emission performance due to natural variation between the mass- produced parts and because they must support multiple configurations, including for various vocational applications. \uf0b7 In addition, although SwRI’s aging protocol may represent the average aging of the emission control system, manufacturers must meet emission limits throughout each engine’s useful life under all in-use conditions. Therefore,', 6: '7 additional margin must be included to ensure that the emission limits are achieved under worst-case aging conditions. \uf0b7 The SwRI data shows insufficient margin to be considered a demonstration of feasibility to the standard. Moreover, while a close-coupled Selective Catalytic Reduction (“SCR”) application (referred to as “LO-SCR” or “light-off SCR” by SwRI) is effective at demonstrating Low NO x in the laboratory, the LO-SCR system must be “close-coupled” to the turbocharger turbine exit to actually be effective. This close-coupled configuration may not be possible for all current commercial vehicle applications due to packaging constraints and heat load impact on temperature sensitive components (such as the Engine Control Module (“ECM”) and AC systems). In some cases, and especially with the smaller range of vehicles in the HD class, packaging constraints will be extremely difficult to overcome. Cab retooling will be necessary in certain instances, as efforts to adequately insulate long runs of exhaust piping will compromise the efficacy of the LO-SCR unit. And, as mentioned above, cab retooling costs can be very high (as much as $500 million), particularly for low-volume products with potentially abbreviated amortization schedules, since those same vehicles will be transitioning to battery-electric and other zero-emissions technologies. With the LO-SCR being larger than the traditional downpipe, additional heat shielding will be required to protect proximate components. That is particularly problematic since the proximate components include much of the Heating, Ventilation and Air Cooling (“HVAC”) hardware, such as heater/evaporator coils, fan air intake, as well as electrical junctions, fuse panel, Powertrain Control Module (“PCM”), relays and other temperature sensitive components. Those thermal issues are exacerbated by the transition to low-GHG HVAC refrigerant HFO 1234yf, where there are additional flammability concerns. Adding length or', 7: '8 height to the vehicle hood to “make room” to mitigate the packaging challenges will compromise bumper-to-back-of-cab limitations, or will increase GHG emissions due to increased aerodynamic drag, or both. Reducing the substrate frontal area to improve packaging will increase backpressure and CO 2  emissions. Due to these constraints, some applications may require vehicle cab redesign to facilitate integration, and other applications may not be able to support this catalyst volume and would therefore be eliminated from commerce. The redesign expense is significant and not included in EPA’s current economic impact analysis. A “first-in-box” application modification or placing a portion of SCR first in a catalyst array currently located under the vehicle is more viable. However, this application results in additional heat loss and further delays the catalyst system’s light off, leading to slightly higher emissions than the laboratory close coupled SCR configuration. In short, commercial vehicles are exposed to a number of variables that are not present in laboratory demonstrations that lead to intrinsic emissions variation and do not necessarily indicate a failed system. Any regulatory proposal must provide flexibility for this variation; if not, systems that have not failed but are simply demonstrating normal variation may be subject to unnecessary recalls, which would be untenable. 2. Variance of Low NO x  Systems EPA has failed to address real-world, in-commerce variation in its feasibility- demonstration efforts. To explore the sensitivity of potential low NO X  solutions in commerce, PACCAR developed a low NO x  system for laboratory demonstration and evaluated the impact of typical real-world sources of variation (i.e., a limited demonstration on one system). The Low NO x  demonstration system was a heated close-coupled SCR combined with a typical REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 8: '9 diesel oxidation catalyst (“DOC”)/ diesel particulate filters (“DPF”)/SCR catalyst system and a current technology diesel engine (i.e., a similar system to the EPA Stage 3 system). The feasibility study focused on developing a demonstration system to achieve Low NO x  on an engine dynamometer over the regulated test cycles. The impact of a wide array of variables on the tailpipe emissions performance was then evaluated. This testing was very limited and revealed only a limited view of the production real-world variability that is expected. EMA’s comments address in detail the “margin stackup” analysis. A large number of real-world variables can affect Low NO x  system performance, such as fuel sulfur (S), biodiesel metals, oil consumption differences, application variation that leads to aging variation, and sensor errors. Major improvements in NO x  sensors accuracy are not foreseen in the proposed low-NO x  standards timeframe. NO x  sensors (three of which are used in the Stage 3 solutions) play a critical role in Diesel Exhaust Fluid (“DEF”) dosing strategies and long-term trim functions. In addition, there are normal variations due to lab-to-lab differences and test-to-test variations. This list of variables evaluated in this exploration are shown below, although they are not as extensive as the potential real world variables. As a result, real world variation may be greater than the levels observed in this limited study. In Test-Cell: \uf0b7 Baseline Tests o Composite FTP, RMC, LLC and Clean Idle \uf0b7 Multiple evaluations for test-to-test variability \uf0b7 Variation due to Fuel Sulfur exposure \uf0b7 Variation due to Sensor Errors within production specification, less than OBD detection limits: REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 9: '10 o ±10%/ 10ppm<100ppm o +7 degC \uf0b7 Variation due to No Precondition o SCR NH3 Empty- due to high temperature operation o Limited precondition \uf0b7 Variation due to Ash Loading in DPF o DPF loaded to point of ash cleaning interval \uf0b7 Variation due to Position (Packaging Limitations) o 1st SCR in underbody configuration \uf0b7 Variation due to Aging \uf0b7 Impact of infrequent regeneration adjustment factors (“IRAF”) The baseline demonstration system produced results below 0.02 g/hp-hr on the composite FTP and RMC test cycles (including IRAF). The variables to be evaluated were then implanted one at a time, although the expectation is that in the real world, varying degrees of these variables and other sources of variation will be active simultaneously. These variables were separated into two subsets: (1) those that result in performance offsets (i.e., not reversible), such as catalyst aging and position relative to the engine, and (2) those that create reversible performance impacts, but may be encountered in testing of production, real world systems (i.e., fuel sulfur, DPF ash loading, sensor offsets, etc. ). A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method was used to estimate uncertainty in baseline performance (based on 23 individual evaluations) and then the data from the offsets and variables and engineering judgement were used to update the baseline results. This approach is robust to small sample sizes. In this analysis it was assumed that the NO x REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 10: '11 emissions are lognormal distribution; NO x >0, long right tail. The baseline distribution is shown below. Figure 1 This baseline variation was then used predict the (regulated) emissions levels that could be met by the system with a stated level of confidence. The criteria used to ensure compliance at a defined emissions level was 98% confidence that 95% of the engines tested would be able to meet the determined emissions level. The analysis was run for two basic groups: engines evaluated in a controlled laboratory environment and engines evaluated with the potential impact of real world variables. The tests were conducted for low miles and aged systems and for close-coupled and “first in box” configurations. For the aged systems and position-shifted systems, the distribution of performance from the baseline close-coupled SCR was assumed to hold, but only the base performance of the systems were shifted. It is likely that under real scenarios, the variation would also expand with the shift in performance, rendering this is a conservative estimate. REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 11: '12 The catalyst aging for this study was limited due to timing constraints. However, the SwRI Low NO x  system (a similar technology package) recently presented results for system aging conducted with hydrothermal and poisons under the DAAAC protocol run on the Stage 3 engine for EPA, and the aged FTP and RMC results at 600,000 and 800,000 miles. The composite FTP and RMC results presented by SwRI for this engine (presented at SAE WCX 2022) at 600,000 miles were 0.027 and 0.038 g/hp-hr NO x  respectively. It is unclear if aging of this demonstration system would be in alignment with the SwRI system, but the results of the SwRI system were leveraged do to the timing constraints. There are also no results to support the analysis for a “first in box” configuration. Figure 2 The standard deviation produced by the “real world” variables identified were evaluated starting from this baseline performance. The results from the laboratory demonstration system and the prediction of performance under real-world (in-commerce) variables are separated into two groups and shown below. These results demonstrate: - a low NO x  systems can be developed and laboratory aged below an Option 2-like standard, but the impact of real world variables will ultimately result in a spread REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 12: '13 in the performance of these systems and create a significant compliance risk in- use; - under either scenario – laboratory or in-use – even a low miles system that is designed for Low NO x  performance would be out of compliance with an Option 1- like standard at a rate high enough to trigger a recall; - a low miles Low NO x  system would require an option 2-like level to be in compliance; and - in-use, an aged Low NO x  system could be out of compliance with an Option 2-like standard in commerce at a rate high enough to trigger a recall. Moreover, the following thresholds were predicted for a specified configuration with the constraint that 95% of the vehicles meet a given emissions level 98% of the time: \uf0b7 0.028 g/hp-hr min threshold for a first in box low mileage system in the laboratory; \uf0b7 0.059 g/hp-hr min threshold for a first in box low mileage system in commerce; \uf0b7 0.045 g/hp-hr min threshold for a 600k miles aged system in the laboratory; \uf0b7 0.119 g/hp-hr min threshold for a 600k mile system in commerce ; and \uf0b7 0.063 g/hp-hr min threshold for a 800k miles aged system in the laboratory. REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 13: '14 Laboratory/ Engine Dyno Predicted  ‘ In Commerce ’ Figure 3 REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 14: '15 These data demonstrate that although a proposed emissions standard may be met in a laboratory-controlled environment under DF, there must be a “variance allowance” for production engines tested from vehicles in commerce. This approach would establish a stringent emissions standard while providing a regulated Variance Allowance that enables compliance under real-world variation and would mitigate the unintended consequence of subjecting normally-functioning systems (i.e., those that have not failed) to recall actions by acknowledging the intrinsic variation of emissions due to real-world variables. Setting a tailpipe emissions standard for durability demonstration, and then providing an “in-commerce” variability allowance, aligns with EPA’s proposed Option 1. In Preamble Section IV(K) titled “Other Flexibilities Under Consideration”, EPA acknowledges: “We understand that manufacturers generally aim to design and build vehicles not only with a sufficient margin to ensure the emissions control technology is meeting the applicable standards throughout the full useful life, but also an additional margin to reflect the fact that not every vehicle manufactured and every vehicle application will perform identically to the laboratory tests. This is particularly important, and challenging for manufacturers, when new technologies and test procedures are being implemented.” 87 FR at 17564. PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA separate the variance allowance from the standard – based on observed standard deviation caused by real world variables – and then add that variance allowance to the standard for in-production performance. This could be accomplished, for example, using the proposed equation below:', 15: '16 In Production Standard = NO x  FEL + VA Where: \uf0b7 NO x  FEL = the standard, including any credit adjustments \uf0b7 VA= variance allowance In sum, PACCAR supports the regulatory levels of Option 2 as feasible under a laboratory controlled scenario, such as DF program durability demonstration, with the addition of a “variability allowance” applied to in-commerce engine testing to account for real-world emission variations. PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA propose a FTP/RMC emission standard in alignment with Option 2 and a variance allowance of  30 mg  for in-commerce testing compliance. Because it is unclear how these variables would diminish over time, EPA should not propose phasing out the variance allowance. The variance allowance should be included for in-commerce engine testing including: \uf0b7 SEA \uf0b7 Conformity Testing \uf0b7 Verification of DF; and \uf0b7 Heavy-Duty In-Use Testing (“HDIUT”). Adopting a single-step feasible rule for MY 2027 will enable manufacturers to focus on the multiple different development paths required for future powertrain solutions. B. Regulatory Useful Life PACCAR supports extending regulatory Useful Life (UL) to more accurately represent Heavy Duty Commercial vehicle operations. However, EPA must ensure', 16: '17 that its UL proposal is cost effective, technically feasible, and that it does not require aftertreatment component replacement. PACCAR supports a 600,000 miles UL standard as technically achievable in commerce. The UL and the emissions standard will dictate whether OEMs will need to replace the aftertreatment system during an engine’s UL to maintain compliance. Emission system drift and variation will increase as the useful life extends, making it increasingly difficult to comply with increasingly stringent emissions standards. If replacing aftertreatment components is the only way to ensure compliance with these stringent emissions standards over the course of the proposed extended useful life, unreasonable cost increases for new HDOH engines and vehicles are inevitable. The stringency of EPA’s proposed Option 1 standard, coupled with (i) the significant uncertainties regarding durability and in-field performance of the new Stage 3 emission-system componentry over the extended useful life periods (up to 700,000 miles) and (2) the strict liability risks under the under the new pass criteria for in- use testing, make it likely that OEMs would need an aftertreatment component replacement strategy to maintain compliance. Simply put, the risk of recalls – perhaps multiple recalls – and the significant associated costs, would be too great for OEMs not to have the option to have an aftertreatment component replacement strategy. PACCAR provides for EPA’s awareness the following additional observations that influence OEMs’ ability to meet extended useful life requirements: \uf0b7 The SwRI demonstration tested emissions on a nominal demonstration engine in a test lab with an artificial aging procedure. In reality,', 17: '18 however, vehicles likely will encounter conditions that lead to higher aging than was demonstrated during the SwRI test, such as specific vehicle duty cycles that lead to higher regeneration frequencies, additional aging due to use of lower quality fuels, and specific engines that have higher oil consumption, etc. \uf0b7 OEMs must certify their nominal demonstration engines far below the legal limit to have sufficient margin for part-to-part, lab-to-lab and aging variation. \uf0b7 The SwRI program shows that the available aftertreatment technology is not capable of controlling drift in emission performance sufficiently to a full useful life of 800,000 miles. \uf0b7 Either the full useful life should be limited to a value well below 800,000 miles, or the emission limit must be increased to have sufficient margin between the SwRI demonstration testing and the regulated limit. PACCAR supports an extended UL demonstration in the lab to ensure aftertreatment system robustness, combined with other flexibilities to reduce the liability of UL in commerce. A viable UL approach should include the following elements: Demonstration Standard: laboratory demo (DF) out to 700,000 miles  Verification of DF: out to 600,000 mile (in-use)  In-commerce Liability for Recall: less than or equal to 600,000 miles Under this scenario, an OEM would be subject to recall up to 600,000 miles UL. Between 600,000 miles and certification demonstration at 800,000 miles, OEMs would be responsible for:', 18: '19 \uf0b7 SEA and \uf0b7 Confirmatory; \uf0b7 But not in commerce. PACCAR does not support the proposed intermediate useful life (IUL) standard. Adding a separate IUL emission limit would add a significant burden because it would double the pass requirements for two separate emission limits. This limits strategies designed to meet UL that may not result in linear degradation of performance but are fully capable of maintaining compliance. The proposed regulation defines IUL in MY 2031 as 435,000 miles / 10 years / 22,000 hours. However, CARB reduced the 10 years to eight years based on 435,000 miles being 72.5% of the 600,000 miles final useful life and eight years being 72.5% of the 11 years final useful life. Consequently, EPA’s standard would be more stringent than CARB’s already non-feasible standard if EPA adopts the IUL as proposed. In sum, PACCAR supports a single step useful life standard at 600,000 miles for in-commerce vehicles and DF validation at MY 2027 and does not support an IUL standard. C. Feasibility of In-Use Emission Standards The proposed revisions to the HDIUT program include two major features that change the regulatory landscape. First, the Proposed Rule imposes a new Three Bin Moving Average Windowing (“3B-MAW”) protocol that attempts to assign periods of engine operation to bins that represent three different ranges of load. Second, the Proposed Rule sets forth a new paradigm in which off-cycle standards are set at levels', 19: '20 far more stringent than what OBD systems are capable of ensuring. PACCAR comments on these proposed revisions below. 1. The Proposed 3B-MAW Requirements Would be Ineffective  in Practice PACCAR opposes the new 3B-MAW requirements because this protocol is ineffective. The 3B-MAW method seeks to distribute overlapping five minute periods of operation among three bins based on load. The idea is to classify similar operation together so that different standards can be applied to each bin to ensure the maximum appropriate level of control is applied to each type of operation. This protocol does not work well in practice due to varied operating conditions and lack of load correlation. PACCAR incorporates by reference the rationale set forth in EMA’s comments, and submits the additional information below. See  EMA Comments at 45. One practical issue with the 3B-MAW requirement is that MAW windows capture a variety of operating conditions that are not in character with the bin description to which they are assigned due to transient load changes that can occur within a window. Furthermore, emissions commonly do not correlate to load, especially for new technology engines that will employ better SCR heating strategies. These SCR heating strategies will result in operation at higher SCR temperatures, which in effect leads to very good emissions control at low loads. The test results from the SwRI demonstration engine confirm as much by demonstrating little NO x difference between bins. In the following example, a truck with a research engine is fitted with a PEMS and undergoes a cold start followed by operation on a test track in a linehaul driving', 20: '21 mode. The entire cold start was captured in Bin 3, which elevated the Bin 3 BSNO x window result by 2.4 times after 2,400 windows relative to the rate observed under stabilized linehaul driving conditions observed between 6,000 and 12,000 seconds. Expanding the number of windows to 10,000 reduced the BSNO x  in bin 3 but it was still 1.5 times the steady emissions rate. Figure 4 In this example, 3B-MAW was not successful at characterizing the steady emission rate under linehaul conditions during a test designed to be exclusively linehaul driving. NO x  breakthroughs can be more frequent under other driving conditions, as demonstrated in the following figure during the grocery delivery cycle. In this', 21: '22 example, the Stage 3 engine was tested at SwRI and showed that it is even more unlikely that operating conditions imagined for Bin 3 can actually be captured in Bin 3 without also capturing data uncharacteristic of Bin 3. Figure 5 Similar periods with transient emissions spikes are possible after engine braking, coasting, idling, and post regeneration which we can call return-to-service (“RTS”) events. RTS events can be captured in any bin and have lasting impact on the final bin results. Even a hot start begins with a period where emissions controls need to stabilize and reestablish various models such as for ammonia storage. A successful in-use compliance strategy will need to target the lowest possible NO x  emissions level at all times to pay for unavoidable NO x  breakthroughs. Test results for Bin 2 and Bin 3 may be very similar in terms of level; however, because of the different standards, Bin 2 complies with excess margin, while Bin 3 fails to demonstrate compliance with adequate margin. REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 22: '23 Another 3B-MAW shortcoming is that bins can be left underpopulated when a drive cycle is either heavily loaded or lightly loaded causing the assignment of the vast majority of the windows to one bin or the other. Lightly populated bins do not have enough data to characterize the typical operation for the engine in that bin. The EMA comments discuss this topic in depth and support the conclusion that 10,000 windows is the minimum number needed to have an acceptable convergence level. EMA Comments at 77. The most effective way to collect 10,000 windows and still complete testing in one shift day is to combine Bins 2 and 3. 2. The On Board Diagnostics (OBD) Changes Contemplated by  the Proposed Rule Contradict OBD’s Intended Propose OBD is critical for ensuring in-use compliance by alerting the vehicle owner when an emissions-related repair is needed. This leads to truck servicing, a warranty claim, additional OEM costs, and customer inconvenience. As a result, there is a strong incentive for manufacturers to design their emission-control systems to be durable and to manufacture accurate OBD systems that can distinguish when the Malfunction Indicator Lamp (“MIL”) must be illuminated. The new Off-Cycle standards set forth in the Proposed Rule create a major shift in regulatory strategy, because the limits are set at a small fraction of the current On-board Diagnostic Emissions Limit (OBDEL), and are well below what is technologically achievable for increased diagnostic sensitivity for most, if not all, fault monitors. This creates a new regulatory landscape where the manufacturer is incentivized to reduce MIL-on thresholds below regulatory requirements to manage the population of non-compliant vehicles in the field.', 23: '24 OBD is a tool to detect malfunctioning trucks and is not intended to be used to reduce the population of units within the expected distribution of wear and deterioration. There are many factors such a technological feasibility, failure rates, emissions impacts, etc. that manufacturer are in the best position assess to optimize the OBD systems to correctly distinguish malfunction from normal wear at levels below the current OBDEL, helping to ensure in-use compliance. The figure below provides a graphical demonstration of how this new regulatory landscape could look. The green line represents how a future technology engine could perform during off-cycle testing, which will include considerable variability caused by the drive cycle and environmental conditions, production variability, and variability in deterioration rates.', 24: '25 Figure 6 This graph illustrates a considerable slope representing the probability of setting a MIL. Diagnostics thresholds are based on an FTP, which is a controlled test, while off-cycle operation is more random and produces a broader spectrum of results. Also, some diagnostics may differ from others due to safety factors, and certain diagnostics can be affected by deterioration. There are limits to what is feasible for OBD diagnostic thresholds. For example, catalyst efficiency monitoring is limited by NO x  sensor accuracy and has limited ability to pinpoint the cause, which leads the service technician to grapple with a complex', 25: '26 troubleshooting tree and costly trial-and-error service actions. If this monitor is used too aggressively, there will be too many false fails and too many units in the normal deterioration range showing up in service bays where no clear service action can be identified to clear the fault. There is no new technological breakthrough for OBD monitors that would be analogous to the technology used for the Stage 3 demonstration engine. The proposed off-cycle limits are too low for OBD to be an effective or appropriate tool to limit the range of emissions rates expected in-use. 3. Compliance Options The following figure is a histogram of the in-use NO x  performance of PACCAR’s current Customer Field Test (“CFT”) fleet having several dozen trucks that are operated in normal customer applications. Data loggers transmit data to PACCAR servers via a contractor. This data can be analyzed to estimate in-use NO x performance based on data from the NO x  sensor. The histogram of the CFT fleet shows about 2,700 simulated in-use tests to predict NO x  performance for vehicles representing the full range of miles within the regulatory useful life. REDACTED AS CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION – SUBMITTED CONFIDENTIALLY  TO EPA IN SEPARATE FILING', 26: '27 Figure 7 Statistical analysis applied to test results from a research engine has predicted a log normal distribution of in-use results depicted in the upper right corner of the figure. The CFT fleet distribution is expected to take on that shape after application of new technology that will pull the peak toward the left and, to a certain extent, move the whole distribution to the left. Some operation missed by inactive NO x  sensors would increase frequency counts to right of the peak if the fleet were measured with PEMS. Much of the long tail of the distribution can be addressed through OBD. However, we can expect frequency counts to remain higher than desired to the right of the peak', 27: '28 over a considerable range of emissions levels. This area is shown as the “challenge area” in the figure and will involve a mix of solutions: \uf0b7 Durability Improvement –  There is no evidence to support the idea  that manufacturers will be better able to improve the durability of  emissions control systems more effectively when motivated by the  HDIUT program than when motivated by the strong incentives of the  existing OBD regulations. Efforts to improve are continuous, but the  scale of future improvements should not be overestimated. Further, the  durability of new systems has not been proven, for example for CDA  hardware and close coupled Catalysts, so it will be difficult not to move  backwards. PACCAR believes that the off-cycle standards proposed by  EMA are attainable through more modest improvements in durability in  line with what PACCAR’s experience has shown to be realistic but with  significant risk in the early years when new technologies are deployed. \uf0b7 New Technology –  Application of improved technology will move the  entire distribution to the left, but with limits. For example the proposed  off-cycle standards will require greatly reduced transient emissions  breakthroughs that are still present in test data from the SwRI  demonstration engine and will require technology beyond that which  was considered for the cost basis of the NPRM to meet option 1  standards. A technical solution can be imagined for every situation but  there is a limit to what is cost effective. Other sections of this document  go into more detail about technological limitations. \uf0b7 OBD –  OBD can be an effective tool when applied to the far right of the  distribution. Application of OBD too far to the left side, without other  solutions, will result in too much MIL illumination due to false detection  or the misclassification of normal deterioration as component failure. It  should be left to manufacturers to set the appropriate emission  thresholds for each fault where root causes of malfunctions can be  effectively identified. \uf0b7 Conformity Factor (CF) –  The conformity factor accounts for the  variation caused by the drive cycle and values of 2 moving to 1.5 are  implied by the NPRM. This makes a major contribution to why the in- use test results fall along a spectrum. The cycle dependence of ultra- low NO x  engines is still largely unknown and remains a risk area for  manufacturers. \uf0b7 Variability Allowance (VA) –  There are many variables that can affect  the performance of a Low NO x  system in the real world such as Sulfur  in fuel, metals in biodiesel, differences in oil consumption, a spectrum  of customer applications that leads to variation in aging, and variation', 28: '29 among sensors. Variation could become significantly magnified under  ultra-low NO x  standards because sources of variation that are small by  today’s standards might not scale down in a linear way when new  technology is applied contributing to sources of variation that are more  significant relative to the standards. \uf0b7 Pass/Fail Determination –  Under the current HDIUT program, if the  MIL lamp is not illuminated then a passing HDIUT test result is almost  guaranteed because the OBD emissions limit is similar to the in-use  emissions limit, which allows the bar to be set relatively high to pass a  test program. Beginning in MY 2027, EPA is proposing the same  pass/fail thresholds of 5 out of 5 tests, 5 out of 6, and new for MY 2027  the program can be passed with the average of 10 test (for all bins and  for all pollutants). This approach is flawed because the off-cycle  standard is set far below the capability of OBD systems and within the  range of expected in-use variation. PACCAR believes that this should be  recognized with Pass/Fail metrics that accommodate more non-passing  engines. Metrics of 4 out of 5, 5 out of 7, or the average of 7 or more  would be more appropriate. The manufacturer should be allowed to test  more than 7, and after some number of engines it would be appropriate  to begin a discussion with EPA about the reason for the extended  testing. Otherwise, these HDIUT tests are generally quite disruptive to  OEM customers’ businesses. This disruption drives the need for earlier  consideration of the average emissions results after testing 7 engines. Testing a greater number of engines the non-normal distribution should  be considered. While we could have an outlier on the high side we can  never have an outlier on the low side by any significant margin (since  negative emissions are not possible). A single outlier on the right side  of the spectrum could be difficult to overcome through averaging and  drive the need to test more engines. The NPRM does not adequately describe the consequences of a non-passing outcome from initial testing. EPA should include a provision for a consultation with the EPA if the pass/fail metrics are not being met to reach a common understanding of the issue and to agree on further actions to investigate the root cause before determining that the engine family fails to meet in-use standards. If the engine family fails to meet in-use standards, there should be an interim provision allowing the manufacturer to cover the non-compliance with credits to allow time for manufacturers to gain experience with the statistical nature of the distribution of in-', 29: '30 use emissions rates for new technologies and a new in-use protocol. There should also be certain permanent alternatives to recall for bringing an engine family into compliance. \uf0b7 Exclusions –  EPA should consider a higher threshold for the proposed  ambient temperature exclusion of -7 °C. For the current HDIUT program  the NTE cold temperature operating exclusion is based on a formula that  considers intake manifold temperature and pressure. For PACCAR trucks  the exclusion becomes active at an ambient temperature between 5 and  20 °C depending on conditions. The new HDIUT program will drive  considerable changes due to the -7 °C ambient temperature threshold  and much lower standards. The amount of heat needed to maintain an  effective SCR temperature increases exponentially as temperature  decreases. This is due to exhaust temperature being proportional to  intake temperature and secondly as ambient temperature decreases  heat loss through the walls of the exhaust system increases. More heat  is needed and less is available, so manufacturers would need to design  and calibrate their heating strategies to deliver an exponentially  increasing large amount of energy into the exhaust as temperature  decreases to meet in-use NO x  limits at very cold ambient temperatures. While technologies exist that can aid in raising exhaust temperature  (i.e., CDA) those technologies will have already been leveraged so the  vast majority of the marginal energy increase for exhaust heat will come  from increased fuel consumption. Furthermore, the capacity to deliver  the necessary energy to the exhaust at -7 °C could require hardware  changes that drive significant costs. The commercial trucking industry in the United States annually  consumes about 40 billion gallons of diesel fuel so even a 0.2% fuel  consumption increase will add nearly one million tons of CO 2  to the  atmosphere annually. Because roughly half of truck operation occurs in  conditions that are too cool to form ground level ozone, there is a  significant opportunity to mitigate climate change by considering the  ambient temperature exclusion for in-use NO x  emissions. A more targeted approach would be to keep the ambient temperature  exclusion at -7 °C and add another exclusion that would be active only  when catalytic aftertreatment temperatures are below 250 °C that  extends to a higher ambient temperature. This which would be similar  to the exclusion for catalytic aftertreatment temperatures as codified in  40 C.F.R. § 86.1370(g), except this exclusion would only be allowed  during cold ambient conditions. This could be thought of as a “GHG  exclusion for cold ambient,” and would ensure engines continue to meet  standards under most operating conditions while not being compelled to', 30: '31 deliver an extreme amount of energy to the exhaust when the  CO 2 /ozone cost benefit is disproportionately high. Emissions control  systems would still be required to be functioning in the exclusion zone  due to requirements for Auxiliary Emission Control Device (AECD’s). The nuance is that the -7 °C ambient temperature exclusion as proposed  in the NPRM drives up the design target for the maximum capacity of  the heating strategy increasing cost, possibly excluding technical  options, and causing more GHG emissions. PACCAR believes the  proposed exclusion is narrow enough to have no meaningful impact on  formation of ozone or secondary PM. PACCAR further encourages the EPA adopt:  The 3B-MAW in-use compliance protocol should be modified as follows: \uf0b7 Bins 2 and 3 should be combined \uf0b7 There should be a 10,000 window minimum in the combined bin Pass ratio: \uf0b7 4 out of 5 \uf0b7 5 out of 7 \uf0b7 Or average of 7 or more \uf0b7 Need provision to allow consultation with EPA if Pass Ratio is not being  met \uf0b7 An interim provision that allows HDIUT non-compliance to be covered  with NO x  credits Ambient temperature exclusion: Increase the threshold for the ambient  temperature exclusion proposed at -7 °C to a higher value or add a new exclusion  only active under both the following conditions: \uf0b7 Catalytic aftertreatment temperature below 250 °C \uf0b7 Ambient temperature below a more modest threshold than -7 °C. D. Warranty and Allowable Maintenance PACCAR agrees with, and incorporates by reference, the following EMA comments: While EPA may permit an engine manufacturer to void an in-use test (or reject  a candidate vehicle) if an aftermarket DPF or other third-party components are  used, there are no such guarantees available to manufacturers when utilizing  some of the alternative compliance demonstration methods. For example,  among the DF verification procedures a manufacturer may use is one which  involves submitting NO x  sensor-based emissions results from a high volume of', 31: '32 vehicles (50% of the family volume) in operation. Similarly, the in-use testing  provisions at §1036.405(g) permit manufacturers to use on-board NO x  sensor  data as a surrogate for PEMS-based testing as a means to satisfy an in-use  test order (the volume requirements are not specified, but EPA may similarly  require a high volume of vehicles to use this provision). In both of those cases,  it is impossible for the manufacturer to inspect each vehicle to confirm that  there are only manufacturer-approved components, or to review vehicle  records to confirm that independent repair facilities have not (mis)performed  maintenance or repairs. In fact, there is no obvious way for a manufacturer  even to investigate those matters, as the affiliated dealers would not possess  such records. In this regard, it is impossible for a manufacturer to adequately  screen to exclude such vehicles from consideration. In the final rule, EPA  should eliminate the requirement to make the independent repair and third- party component statement as proposed. If EPA chooses not to delete the requirements of §1036.125(f), EPA has  allowed the provision to be disregarded only under one of two conditions. The  first condition is that the manufacturer commit in the purchase agreement to  provide components or services free of charge. While it is not clear whether  this is with respect only to any isolated, named components or services, or to  all components or services, the requirement is nonetheless unreasonable. The  second condition is to demonstrate to the Agency that the “engine” will work  properly with the “identified” component or service. This would mean that the  manufacturer would have to be aware of  all  possible sources for the service or  components, and to have explicit knowledge about  all  the services or  components and their potential impact to emissions, which is impossible, and  therefore unworkable. EPA’s maintenance-related requirements go on to require additional  information to be included in the owner’s manual. Under §1036.125(h)(2),  manufacturers must “identify steps owners must take to qualify their engines  as properly maintained, consistent with the requirements of this section.”  The owner’s manual must also instruct owners as to what “documentation  you [the manufacturer] consider appropriate for making these  demonstrations.” These requirements are not practical. First, there’s an  implication that owners are “on notice” as to documentation responsibilities,  and are somehow responsible to maintain emissions-related maintenance  records. Second, it makes no sense for the manufacturer, speaking through  the owner’s manual, to advise what should be done to “qualify” their engines  as “properly maintained.” Not only is it totally foreign to customers to  “qualify” their purchased products in any way, but there would be an  underlying sentiment that overlooking other maintenance requirements  might nonetheless still provide for a vehicle that is “properly maintained.”  The whole of §1036.125(h)(2) is inappropriate and unreasonable on its face,  and should be removed from the final rule.', 32: '33 EMA opposes the proposed requirement to describe the emissions control  system and OBD trouble codes (§§1036.125(h)(4) through (8)) in such detail  as to give owners the sense that they could apply “backyard mechanic” skills  to repair complex emissions control systems, despite a complete lack of  training, and without the correct tools to make quality repairs to restore  emissions control. Just the opposite could happen, where the actions of the  owner could lead to other component issues and potentially more severe  emissions exceedance. Today’s technicians connect to the emissions control  system with qualified tools to perform diagnostic routines, resetting  parameters when new sensors are installed. This level of rigor is required to  take appropriate corrective action on today’s complex emissions control  systems. EPA should abandon the proposal to compel manufacturers to educate owners  on repair processes through the owner’s manual. The proposed requirements  of §§1036.125(h)(4) through (8) should be deleted in the final rule. ‘ See  EMA Comments at 123-25. Proposed section 1036.125(a) Critical emission-related maintenance, states: “Critical emission-related maintenance includes any adjustment, cleaning, repair, or replacement of components listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. This may also include other maintenance that you determine is critical, including maintenance on other critical emission-related components as defined in 40 CFR part 1068, if we approve it in advance. You may perform scheduled critical emission-related maintenance during service accumulation on your emission-data engines at the intervals you specify.” PACCAR submits that, in the spirit of lengthening useful life to improve long-term performance durability, EPA should allow manufacturers to implement proactive, predictive maintenance strategies if they proactively monitor and identify potential maintenance issues. Under this type of maintenance regime, the manufacturer can become aware, but would not necessarily know in advance, that a particular component is in need of maintenance. This approach would', 33: '34 incentivize preventative maintenance, and even goes further by promoting vehicle service before any malfunction occurs, which would lead to emission reductions. EPA should therefore support and encourage these initiatives, including by allowing targeted maintenance subject to EPA approval. Rather than penalizing maintenance initiatives as failures, EPA should encourage manufacturers to take the initiative to prevent malfunctions in the first place. The following proposed regulatory provision would accomplish this goal: “Vehicle connectivity and advanced analytics (machine learning, cloud computing, etc.) enable pattern recognition and predictive analytics. The OEM shall be allowed to use advanced predictive measures to proactively remedy potential emissions related part failures, and these actions shall not be counted as a failure for the purpose of the emissions warranty. This strategy recognizes the breadth of customer use conditions and the potential uneven impact on long-term engine performance. The OEM may choose how and when to alert the driver when a proactive measure is required. The cost of these repairs would be covered by the OEMs. EPA must approve the OEM’s proposed action before it is initiated.” Examples of Predictive Preventive Maintenance include: o Component is predicted to fail within a prescribed number of days o OEM identifies next scheduled maintenance o OEM includes the component repair with next scheduled maintenance o Pro-actively repaired vehicles avoid unplanned downtime o These actions must be excluded from filtered failures for reporting', 34: '35 PACCAR encourages EPA to revise the Proposed Rule to allow for more preventative maintenance in the spirit of emissions reduction under the Clean Air Act. E. Average Banking and Trading Program PACCAR supports EPA’s initiative to offer NO X  credits to incentivize ZEV adoption. See  proposed § 1037.616 (NO x  credits for electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles). Promulgating a NO x  ABT program provides manufacturers with the needed flexibility to plan investments and manage product costs, while also providing time to overcome technical or lead-time challenges. Although we support starting the NO X credit bank for ZEVs and early credit in MY 2024, we do not support using NO X  credits from earlier technology engines (i.e., pre-MY 2024) because EPA should further incentivize producing new low NO x  and ZEV technologies. PACCAR also supports establishing a NO X  FEL cap to avoid backsliding if ZEVs proliferate, and a reasonable NO X  cap would support manufacturers’ technological investments and provide manufacturers additional product planning flexibility to meet the NO x  standard, while allowing them to focus research and development engineering resources toward future products. PACCAR agrees with the following EMA comments: However, because of the uncertainty associated with market adoption of zero  and near-zero NO x  emissions technologies, EMA recommends that EPA modify  the  proposal  to  include  certain  constraints  to  prevent  unintended consequences from the ABT program. For example, a relatively unconstrained  ABT program could lead to competitive imbalances among manufacturers,  especially where product mix differences exist. More specifically, if zero-NO x emissions technologies sold in one market subsegment are used to bank  significant NO x  credits, those could 132 be used to offer higher-emitting, lower- cost engines in a different market subsegment, competing against another  manufacturer without credits and that, as a result, is only able to offer lower  emitting, higher-cost engines. That would disrupt the current competitively', 35: '36 level playing field in that subsegment of the market, and could discourage the  purchase of lower-emitting engines. To prevent such an unintended outcome, EPA should maintain its current NO x ABT averaging set categories based on primary intended service classes (i.e.,  HDE SI, LHDE CI, MHD CI, and HHD CI). To include zero-emissions powertrains  (that are neither spark-ignited nor compression-ignited internal combustion  engine-based) in the ABT program, EPA should prescribe how to align its  vehicle-level primary intended service classes from EPA’s Heavy-Duty GHG  Phase 2 regulations in 40 CFR Part 1037 with the appropriate engine-based  NO x  averaging set. To further prevent unintended consequences, EPA should reduce the FTP/RMC  NO x  FEL cap to be no higher than 0.100 g/bhp-hr for all service classes. Setting  that lower FEL cap also will help to mitigate the competitive problems described  above. With those averaging set and FEL cap provisions in place to protect  against unintended consequences, EMA recommends that EPA allow unlimited  NO x  credit life, in lieu of the Agency’s proposed 5-year credit life. EMA Comments at 131-32. EPA should propose an initiative to encourage turning- over outdated fleets. EPA should incentivize removing these high emission vehicles in an effort to accelerate the environmentally-beneficial newer Low NO X  technologies. An analysis of vehicle registration data was conducted to explore the makeup of heavy-duty Class 8 vehicle on the road today. In this analysis, registration data updated in the first quarter of 2022 was evaluated to determine the number of trucks, by vehicle Model Year (engine Model Year is Vehicle MY-1) on the road today Vehicle registration data analysis shows that 41% of today’s Class 8 vehicles on the road are pre-2010 MY vehicles. EPA should therefore revise proposed section 1036.705 (NO X credit generating and calculating emissions credit) to accelerate retiring these pre- 2010 vehicles. Pre 2010               1,467,116   41% Post 2010               2,110,331   59% Total               3,577,447', 36: '37 Figure 8 EPA should allow vehicle manufacturers to offer incentives to pre-MY 2010 vehicle owners in the form of vouchers that can be applied to the purchase of a new technology vehicle. In exchange for retiring a pre-MY 2010 vehicle, EPA should allow the manufacturer to bank NO x  credits in the new federal NO x  bank. An exploration of the NO x  generation, using the NO X  credit equation provided by EPA is used to illustrate the significance of this proposal. The NO X  emission credit equation proposed by EPA is: This equation was used to explore the Mega gram of NO X  emission (or displaced emission) from Zero Emission Vehicles and Current and Future CI diesel engines for a Class 8 HHDE. The lifetime emission was calculated by setting “FEL” to zero. The lifetime NO X  emission (for a CI diesel) or credit (for a ZEV) for an EPA MY2010-2026 powertrain is about 0.4 mega-grams. For the MY2027 and later vehicle certifying to a 0.05 NO X  standard the lifetime emission of NO X  is about 0.1 mega-grams of NO X .', 37: '38 The analysis then explored the emission of NO X  from a pre-2010 vehicles over approximately one year (assumed to be about 40,000 miles for illustration). The emissions from a Class 8 MYs 1996-2003 and a MYs 2003-2009 diesel engine over one year of operation was estimated to be 0.66 and 0.41 mega-grams of NO X , respectively. This example illustrates that these vehicles are emitting about four times the predicted lifetime emission of a proposed MY 2027 and later Low NO X  diesel engine, every year. Figure 9 Therefore EPA should allow vehicle manufacturers to provide incentives to their customers to trade in their older vehicles for a new technology vehicle, and then OEMs should be allowed to bank NO X  credits equivalent to one year of NO X  emission from the older technology vehicle. OEMs would “retire” the traded-in vehicle, meaning its engine would be seized or otherwise made permanently inoperable. This “Credits for Clunkers” scenario would benefit both the Agency and manufacturers: EPA can realize accelerated real-world emission reductions and manufactures can use the displaced real-world NO X  to ease the transition into the new Low NO X  technology. Also, by taking only one year of credit, the benefit realized by the agency will be', 38: '39 much greater than the credit given. Additionally, the new Low NO x  technology trucks will also provide emissions control under low load operation, where the older technology vehicles are not as well controlled and produce much higher NO X emissions. F. Other Flexibilities PACCAR supports the following EMA comment: EPA has also requested comment on a 5% annual sales flexibility to  address specialty vehicle applications. In that regard, EMA recommends  a low-volume “legacy engine” flexibility provision that a manufacturer  could utilize for the most challenging applications. Specifically, EMA  recommends that the final rule provide that a manufacturer may sell US  10-compliant engines in volumes up to 5% of their total annual sales  volume in the same primary intended service class for a period of 3  years. EMA recommends further limiting this flexibility provision to  include only engines that have low annual average miles traveled,  thereby minimizing the emissions inventory consequences of this  flexibility allowance. This can be achieved by allowing legacy engine  sales only from the following engine and vehicle applications:  1) ≥525  hp engine family sales into any vehicle application [PACCAR respectfully  submits that this lower threshold should be 510 hp]; and  2) any engine  sales that are directed for installation in the following 40 CFR Part 1037  vehicle categories: heavy-haul tractors, custom chassis motor homes,  concrete mixers, and emergency vehicles. All those engine and vehicle  categories have very low average annual vehicle miles traveled. EMA  supports EPA’s proposal to allow for limited sales of previous-Tier  engines according to the limitations as described. EMA Comments at 132. PACCAR also proposes to add the following provision to those above: 3) Low Volume highly specialized vocational applications that will not support  the installation of these Low NO X  systems due to severe packaging constraints. These applications are to be reviewed and approved by EPA on a case by case  basis.” This would protect manufacturers from unforeseen issues that might  arise with very specialized products.', 39: '40 III. SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON PROPOSED REGULATORY PROVISIONS Paccar also respectfully submits the following specific comments on the Proposed Rule. A. EPA Proposed Clean Idle Testing Provisions but Did Not Propose  Corresponding Clean Idle Labeling Provisions PACCAR supports EPA’s proposal to include a voluntary “low NO x  idle” emissions standard. The specific proposed standards are a concern, however, because compliance to an idle-NO x  standard is contingent upon the low-NO x technologies that will need to be deployed to meet the FTP, RMC and LLC standards, which will not be fully known until the NPRM is finalized. For MY 2024 to MY 2026 there are no significant nation-wide planned engine or aftertreatment upgrades currently anticipated, even though meeting the level proposed for MYs 2024 to 2026 (10.0 g/hr) would not be possible with today’s technology. Since there is no major planned change to technology until MY 2027, PACCAR does not support a decrease from the current level until MY 2027. PACCAR supports a standard that does not encourage backsliding and thus supports 30.0 g/hr through 2027. At the next step in the regulation to Low NO X  in 2027, PACCAR would support a 10.0 g/hr standard with a 5.0 g/hr in-commerce variance allowance that is aligned with the anticipated technology to meet that regulated level. Although PACCAR generally supports the proposed “Clean Idle test” provisions ( see  40 C.F.R. § 1036.514), PACCAR did not identify any corresponding Clean Idle label provisions. If EPA intends to promulgate Clean Idle testing provisions, it should also promulgate Clean Idle labeling provisions to enable local enforcement personnel to easily identify clean idle compliant vehicles. EPA should also secure agreement from CARB to accept the EPA clean idle provision,', 40: '41 thereby allowing federally-compliant labeled Clean Idle vehicles to idle in California and other CARB-aligned jurisdictions. B. PACCAR Recommends EPA Revise Certain Aspects of the  Proposed System Health Monitoring Provisions PACCAR is committed to ensuring OBD systems “generally detect malfunctions in the emission control system, store trouble codes corresponding to detected malfunctions, and alert operators appropriately.” 40 C.F.R. § 1036.110 Diagnostic controls (proposed). However, PACCAR has identified two primary issues with the proposed system health monitoring provisions that EPA should amend. First, for particulate filter information, EPA proposed to require an “[i]ndicator of historical and current active  and passive  regeneration frequency” as section 1036.110(c)(3)(B) of the regulations. 87 Fed. Reg. 17414, 17666 (March 28, 2022) (emphasis added). But it is technically infeasible to control or track passive regeneration frequency due to, among other things, temperature and oxygen exhaust concentration variability. This variability would inevitably lead to inaccurate monitoring because the indicator would not be able to record correctly each passive regeneration event. PACCAR therefore urges EPA to remove the proposed passive regeneration frequency indicator requirement. Second, for SCR-related information, EPA proposed to require “[i]nformation describing any detected flow obstruction in DEF lines or dosing valve in anticipation of triggering an inducement.”  Id . These proposed requirements are also technologically infeasible and should be withdrawn. The plethora of variables, e.g., ambient temperature at which the DEF freezes, whether there are thawing heaters,', 41: '42 etc., makes it impossible to design a function that would accurately assess obstruction information. In addition, PACCAR notes that the cross-referenced CARB citation in proposed § 1036.110(b)(6) needs to be corrected. The proposed provision purports to cite to “testing and reporting requirements” but instead incorrectly cites to engine aging requirements. Id. at 17665 (incorrectly citing to 13 CCR 1971.1(i)(2.3-2.4). EPA should revise the final rule to include the proper citation. C. The DEF Dosing Diagnostic Testing Provision Should be Amended PACCAR supports having trained technicians perform DEF dosing diagnostic testing under proper conditions. But proposed section § 1036.110(c)(2) would require that “[d]iagnostic testing to measure the effectiveness of DEF dosing . . . be made available for use with either a generic scan tool or an equivalent alternative method  (such as an option commanded through a vehicle system menu). (emphasis added). This proposed provision is problematic for a number of reasons. Currently, trained technicians ensure proper conditions before conducting DEF dose diagnostic testing. Requiring generic scan tool or equivalent testing would lead to testing that is conducted under improper conditions, e.g., the catalyst must be at the appropriate temperature to ensure proper dosing, and misuse. Both scenarios likely will cause engine, catalyst or other systematic damage, which would have an adverse impact on emissions. PACCAR therefore submits that the risks associated with the DEF dosing diagnostic testing proposal significantly outweigh any purported benefits. EPA should revise its proposal to remove the DEF dosing diagnostic testing requirement and leave such testing to trained technicians.', 42: '43 D. The Proposed Rule Should Allow OEMs to Replace and/or Repair  Catalyst Beds and Particulate Filters as Scheduled Maintenance  During an Engine’s Useful Life PACCAR recommends that EPA revise the proposed provisions governing “minimum scheduled maintenance intervals” within 40 C.F.R. § 1036.125. As proposed, § 1036.125(a)(2) provides that “[y]ou may not schedule replacement of catalyst beds or particulate filters during an engine’s useful life.” However, PACCAR respectfully submits that EPA should follow the California Air Resources Board’s regulatory approach and allow OEMs to replace and/or repair catalyst beds and particulate filters during an engine’s useful life. See California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2004 and Subsequent Model Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines and Vehicles  (as amended April 18, 2019) 1  (incorporated by reference at 13 CCR § 1956.8(d)) (incorporating 40 C.F.R. § 86.004-25 with changes, including the addition of catalytic converter beds and particulate filters to the list of functions that manufacturers can replace during an engine’s useful life) (stating in relevant part that “manufacturers may schedule replacement or repair of particulate trap elements (or trap oxidizer elements), catalytic converter beds (including NO x  adsorber, diesel oxidation catalyst, and selective catalyst reduction beds) . . . provided that the manufacturer demonstrates to the Executive Officer’s satisfaction that the repair or replacement will be performed according to the schedule and the manufacturer pays for the repair or replacement.”) 1  Available at  https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020- 06/hddtps_warranty_clean%20complete_10_19_accessible.pdf .', 43: '44 If EPA’s final rule retains the general proposed catalyst beds or particulate filters prohibition – and even though PACCAR urges EPA to promulgate reasonable, technically-feasible emissions standards, useful life and warranty provisions that will not force the replacement of catalyst beds to remain compliant -- PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA provide an exception under which OEMs may repair or replace catalyst beds and particulate filters if the manufacturer demonstrates to EPA’s satisfaction that the repair or replacement will be performed according to the manufacturer-proposed maintenance schedule and the manufacturer pays for the repair or replacement. Such an exception is particularly warranted in light of EPA’s substantially extended useful life and warranty proposals beginning in MY 2027. Moreover, revising the prohibition on replacing or repairing catalyst beds or particulate filters would be consistent with EPA’s preamble, which provides: “Current 40 CFR 86.004 25(i) clarifies that these components could be replaced or repaired if manufacturers demonstrate the maintenance will occur and the manufacturer pays for it. We propose to continue to restrict replacement of catalyst beds and particulate filter elements, requiring that manufacturers pay for the repair or replacement of catalyst beds and particulate filter elements, if needed, within the regulatory useful life.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 17525. PACCAR therefore respectfully submits that EPA should modify proposed § 1036.125(a)(2) as follows: “You may not schedule replacement of catalyst beds or particulate filters during an engine’s useful life., except as allowed in paragraph (g) [Payment for scheduled maintenance]. However, manufacturers may schedule', 44: '45 replacement or repair of particulate trap elements (or trap oxidizer elements), catalytic converter beds (including NO x  adsorber, diesel oxidation catalyst, and selective catalyst reduction beds), provided that the manufacturer demonstrates to EPA’s satisfaction that the repair or replacement will be performed according to the schedule and the manufacturer pays for the repair or replacement.” Corresponding changes would need to be made as well, including to the deterioration factor verification provisions. Specifically, § 1036.246(c)(4) should be amended to allow using engines that undergo replacement or repair per the revised provisions above. E. Certain  Aspects  of  the  Proposed  Provisions  Governing Demonstrating Compliance with Criteria Pollutant Emission  Standards Should be Amended PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA clarify its expectations regarding off- cycle data demonstrations. Specifically, proposed § 1036.240(b) provides: “Your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing an official emission result or a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable emission standard (including all corrections and adjustments). Similarly, your engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing any emission level above the applicable off-cycle emission standard for any pollutant. This also applies for all test points for emission data-engines within the family used to establish deterioration factors.” This section of the regulation discusses DF. The emissions-data engine is only operated in a test cell, and is not intended for installation in a vehicle. This open-', 45: '46 ended provision does not provide stakeholders with the regulatory certainty that is needed to allow them to ensure compliance and therefore should be revised. For example, the regulation should further clarify the contours of what is contemplated by “off-cycle emission standard.” And the statement that “[y]our engine family is deemed not to comply if any emission-data engine representing that family has test results showing an official emission result or a deteriorated emission level for any pollutant that is above an applicable emission standard” could be read to suggest that DF engines would be installed and tested in on-road vehicles, which of course would be inconsistent with industry practice. PACCAR therefore requests that EPA remove this proposed provision. Proposed section §1036.240(c) also needs to be revised. As proposed, OEMs would be required to take into account in-use testing in calculating DF. This is not possible. DF is an aging exercise on a single emission data engine with a prescribed DF method that measures low-hour performance and deteriorated performance, from which a curve is determined. Although accepted methods are listed in §1036.240(c)(1)-(4), in-use data is not mentioned and the proposed regulation does not describe how to incorporate in-use data into DF. F. Certain Deterioration Factors for Exhaust Emission Standards  Provisions Should be Amended PACCAR supports that the Proposed Rule currently contemplates two ways in which OEMs may determine deterioration factors: either “[o]perate the emission-data engine in the certified configuration on an engine dynamometer to represent the useful  life”  or  “[d]etermine  deterioration  factors  based  on  bench-aged', 46: '47 aftertreatment.” § 1036.245(b)(1)-(2). PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA promulgate a third option that is essentially a combination of the two described above. EPA appears to have contemplated including this third option – a combination of engine dynamometer aging and accelerated bench-aged aftertreatment aging. The preamble states: “In addition, under our proposed new DF determination option, manufacturers would be able to perform dynamometer testing of an engine and aftertreatment system to a mileage that is less than regulatory useful life. Manufacturers would then bench age the aftertreatment system to regulatory useful life and combine the aftertreatment system with an engine that represents the engine family. Manufacturers  would  run  the  combined  engine  and  bench-aged aftertreatment for at least 100 hours before collecting emission data for determination of the deterioration factor.” 87 Fed. Reg. at 17548. PACCAR therefore recommends that EPA promulgate this third option, which also would be consistent with CARB’s regulatory approach. See  FINAL California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2004 and Subsequent Model Heavy-Duty Diesel Engines and Vehicles at § B1.1.1.4. In addition, the proposed bench-aged aftertreatment option would require that the OEM “[c]reate a linear curve fit if testing includes intermediate points.” 40 C.F.R. § 1036.245(2)(iv) (proposed). But EPA should amend this provision to allow for a nonlinear curve fit if there is sufficient supporting data. The common curve degrades quickly initially and then has a more gradual slope over the majority of the useful life.', 47: '48 G. The Verifying Deterioration Factors Provisions Should be  Amended Certain aspects of the proposed deterioration factor verification provisions should be revised. First, PACCAR requests that EPA revise its proposal to make clear that DF verification testing is not required on model years that use carry-over DF data from previous model years. EPA should add clarifying regulatory language to proposed §1036.246, such as: “Carry-over of Deterioration Factors is allowed if there are no major hardware changes (e.g., a change in catalyst technology) that affect the deterioration of emissions; as such a single verification of deterioration factors on the first model year using the specific DFs should suffice to verify the validity of the DFs.” In addition, PACCAR submits that proposed 40 C.F.R. § 1036.246(d)(1)(i) requires clarification. Currently, the proposed section provides: “Test at least two engines using the procedures specified in subpart F of this part and 40 CFR part 1065. Install the aftertreatment system from the selected in-use vehicle, including all associated wiring, sensors, and related hardware and software, on one of the following partially complete engines.” PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA clarify that this proposed provision would require testing two  aftertreatment systems  and that the testing can be done on a single engine. Proposed section § 1036.246(d)(3) also needs to be revised. EPA proposes to require data from 50% of the engines produced for Option 3, as opposed to only 2 engines for Option 1, and 5 engines for Option 2. The option proposed by EPA requires 1Hz data, meaning that physical recorders must be installed in the vehicles to', 48: '49 measure the required data. PACCAR proposes to reduce the demonstration requirements for Option 3 to five engines as in Option 2. PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA remove the proposed requirement that measured  emission  results  must  be  adjusted  for  IRAF. See   proposed § 1036.246(d)(2)-(3) (requiring IRAF be added to the measured emission results). Although infrequent regeneration adjustment factors are determined during FTP, RMC and LLC test cycles, no IRAF values exist for in-use testing. In fact, the EPA proposed in-use test requirements in §1036.515 specifically exclude emissions during regeneration, i.e., no IRAF adjustment is required. Finally, EPA should revise proposed §1036.246(h)(3). As proposed in the NPRM, this provisions essentially provides that a new deterioration factor must be established after one additional model year if verification testing indicates that the emissions do not meet legal requirements. However, OEMs must have sufficient time to perform a new DF procedure, and, for proposed MY 2027 regulations, this may take nine to twelve months. To illustrate this challenge, if an OEM were to determine in December 2028 that its MY 2027 DF verification test failed, it would likely take until early 2030 for the OEM to complete a new DF program, notwithstanding that the certification application for the MY 2030 program will need to be submitted by mid-2029. Because OEMs would reasonably need more than one model year to comply with the proposed requirements in (h)(3), PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA allow OEMs to carry-over the existing DF for two additional model years, rather than the proposed “one additional model year.”', 49: '50 H. The  Proposed  Infrequently  Regenerating  Aftertreatment Devices Provisions Should be Revised Proposed § 1036.522 addresses infrequently regenerating aftertreatment devices. As an initial matter, operation in the Low Load Cycle conditions may not trigger regeneration events under real-world conditions, especially in extreme low- load conditions. Manufacturers must therefore be afforded additional flexibility to address this issue, by, for example, being able to use FTP-derived IRAF values, or by omitting IRAF values if manufacturers can demonstrate that regenerations are unlikely to occur under real-world, low-load conditions. Proposed § 1036.522 additionally requires manufacturers to determine the regeneration frequency for each duty cycle. However, identifying specific in-use regeneration intervals per individual certification cycle (FTP, RMC or LLC) is complicated due to the generally wide-ranging duty cycles between regeneration intervals, e.g., if a vehicle runs 50 hours in city conditions and 50 hours in motorway conditions during a 100 hour regeneration interval, it is not possible to determine whether the data should be used in the overall calculation of the RMC, the FTP or the LLC frequency. Using back-to-back dynamometer emission cycles to determine regeneration intervals does not lead to representative in-use regeneration frequencies and durations. Customers are unlikely to drive the same or similar duty- cycles during their complete regeneration interval, which is the main factor that determines a regeneration frequency. Finally, effects of cold-starts and ambient conditions are not accurately simulated in back-to-back dyno cycles. EPA should therefore retain the option to determine a single regeneration frequency and duration', 50: '51 that is used to calculate the IRAF for all emission cycles based on the average regeneration frequency of customer vehicles over all duty cycles. PACCAR respectfully submits that using average customer in-use data is a more appropriate method to determine regeneration frequencies and durations. I. The Proposed Rule Should Treat NO x  Credit Deficits and CO 2 Credit Deficits Similarly PACCAR generally supports EPA’s proposed Subpart H Averaging, Banking, and Trading amendments, including those addressing NO x  Family Emission Limit (FEL) credits and credit generation for Zero Emission Vehicles. However, EPA should amend § 1036.745, which currently only addresses “end-of-year  CO 2  credit deficits” to address NO x  credit deficits as well. Although OEMs are increasingly adopting ZEV technology and business strategies, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the extent to which consumers will embrace and purchase ZEVs in substantial quantities, and whether there will be adequate nationwide charging infrastructure in place in the near future to accommodate ZEV fleets. See e.g. , McKinsey & Company, Building the Electric-Vehicle Charging Infrastructure America Needs , (April 18, 2022) (estimating that the United States would need almost 20 times more EV chargers than it has now to achieve federal ZEV sale targets). 2  For OEMs, the uncertainty surrounding ZEV purchases means uncertainty about credit generation, and the final end-of-year MY accounting does not take place until September 30 of the calendar year following the MY, which makes resolving NO x  credit deficits within one MY following the deficit extremely difficult. In light of this uncertainty, OEMs need to 2  Available at:  https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our- insights/building-the-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-america-needs', 51: '52 have the same flexibility for NO x  credit deficits that exists for CO 2  credit deficits. This includes allowing OEMs to remedy NO x  credit deficits “with surplus credits within three model years.” 40 C.F.R. § 1036.745(e). J. Warranty and Allowable Maintenance As discussed above, PACCAR supports EPA’s initiative to extend Heavy-Duty engine warranty periods to cover a greater portion of UL. We specifically support a single step in MY 2027, which is aligned with CARB Step 1 Warranty period, and EPA’s proposed Option 2 of 350,000 miles. This step would increase the UL warranty coverage from 22% to 58% of useful life based on a 600,000 commercial useful life. PACCAR also supports other approaches to ensure long-term in commerce-emissions performance and initiatives that work to incentivize fleet turn over to facilitate the adoption of the new low NO X  technology. However, we have concerns about certain aspects of EPA’s proposal that addresses warranty and allowable maintenance. Proposed section 1036.120(c) addresses“[c]omponents covered” and provides that “the emission-related warranty covers all components whose failure would increase an engine’s emissions of any regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068, appendix A, and components from any other system you develop to control emissions. The emission-related warranty covers these components even if another company produces the component .” (emphasis added). This broadly worded section needs to revised. Manufacturers have invested billions of dollars developing their products to ensure and maintain emission systems compliance, while keeping pace with increasingly stringent emissions standards. However, as proposed, EPA’s provision conceivably could make OEMs liable for', 52: '53 customers installing non- original manufacturer-produced components. OEMs are incapable of validating third-party produced components to ensure they comply with respect to emissions performance and durability as the original manufacturer’s components. OEMs accordingly should not be potentially liable for components produced by another company. Proposed section 1036.125(f) also should be revised. The NPRM provides: “Source of parts and repairs. State clearly on the first page of your written maintenance instructions that a repair shop or person of the owner\'s choosing may maintain, replace, or repair emission control devices and systems. Your instructions may not require components or service identified by brand, trade, or corporate name . Also, do not directly or indirectly condition your warranty on a requirement that the engine be….."" 87 Fed. Reg. at 17514. This aspect of EPA’s Proposed Rule is inconsistent with the goals of EPA’s UL to ensure long-term emissions compliance. Allowing stakeholders to use un- validated, non-branded parts to repair emissions systems that are must meet new Low NO x  extended durability and performance requirements does not make sense. First, the proposal does not expressly require that any stakeholder validate that the parts meet the durability and variance requirements needed to maintain the performance of the original equipment manufacturer’s emissions system throughout full useful life. The OEM should not be legally responsible for these unbranded parts, let alone have to include the failure in the warranty failure analysis. Finally, as proposed, section 1036.125(h)(6) states that manufacturers should “Include exploded-view drawings to allow the owner  to identify the part numbers  and', 53: '54 basic assembly requirements for turbochargers, aftercoolers, and all components required for proper functioning of EGR and aftertreatment devices. Include enough detail to allow a mechanic to replace any of those components.” (emphasis added). As parts are improved and updated, part numbers will change and be superseded. Therefore, EPA should revise its Proposed Rule to allow industry to identify these parts by name instead of number. K. The Manufacturer-Run Field-testing Program Provisions Should  be Revised PACCAR respectfully requests that EPA amend certain aspects of the proposed manufacturer-run field-testing program. First, proposed section § 1036.405(d) states: “We will typically select engine families for testing and notify you in writing by June 30 of the applicable calendar year.” PACCAR submits that EPA should make its selection in  January  of the applicable calendar year, rather than June. EPA has proposed an additional step that requires OEMs prepare a test plan that EPA must approve. Because the 18-month “clock” does not start running until the test plan is approved, the test period must begin earlier than June so OEMs have  two  summers and one winter (instead of two winters and only one summer) for testing. Winter testing is logistically difficult and has certain risks. For example, PACCAR uses a trailer, which weighs nearly 10,000 pounds and contains analyzers and other equipment worth up to $1 million, to support PEMS testing that is towed with a light- duty truck. Not only does conducting PEMS testing in the winter on icy roads create unnecessary risks, it also increases workplace safety risks that are inherent to', 54: '55 working outside in icy conditions. EPA should therefore make its selection in January to accommodate additional summer testing. Second, proposed § 1036.405(g) allows OEMs to use on-board NO x measurement system verification per 40 C.F.R. § 1065.920(b) in lieu of PEMS testing. But it would be impossible for OEMs to comply with the requirements in § 1065.920(b), including with respect to how long sensors would be required to function. Rather than codify this impossible-to-meet option, EPA should amend proposed § 1036.405(g) and simply include the following language EPA has already proposed: ""You must show us that the alternative program gives comparable assurance that your engines meet the NO x  standards of this part.” L. The Provisions Addressing Selecting and Screening Vehicles and  Engines for Testing Should be Clarified Proposed section § 1036.410(c) would require the manufacturer to notify EPA “before disqualifying any vehicle.” PACCAR seeks clarification that this proposal is a reporting requirement, as opposed to a statement that the disqualification is contingent on EPA approval. M. EPA Should Amend Its Proposed Provisions Governing Preparing  and Testing Engines Proposed § 1036.415(g) provides that “[y]ou may ask us to waive testing relative to one or more emission standards if you can show that field testing for such emissions is not necessary.” EPA must provide OEMs additional flexibilities. As a general matter, the proposed HDIUT testing needs to be streamlined to make the individual tests less burdensome because overall testing is expected to increase due to (i) more cases where 7 to 10 engines will need to be tested and', 55: '56 (ii) possible separate engine families for California. PEMS testing requires skilled engineers and technicians who are willing and able to carry out challenging, physical work while traveling in harsh environments and expending long hours often during the night. These individuals are always very difficult – and currently nearly impossible – to find. HDIUT testing also significantly disrupts OEM customers rendering recruiting participants extremely challenging. To sustain a base of customers that are willing to participate, and to make the proposed program potentially feasible, OEMs would need to drastically reduce installation time, vehicle space, and electrical power. On this issue, PACCAR incorporates EMA’s Comments on this subject. See  EMA Comments at 41. N.  The Pass Criteria for Individual Engines Should be Revised Proposed § 1036.420 is flawed because a ten percent margin is much too small. In any event, PACCAR expects SwRI’s ongoing work will support a much different PEMS accuracy margin and encourages EPA to use those findings to establish the margin. Second, proposed § 1036.420(c) contemplates 2,400 as the minimum number of windows in each bin. However, 2,400 windows is insufficient for a stabilized test result and is also too many windows to reliably finish a test in a shift day. Because there are no practical number of windows that could support the proposed binning scheme, Bins 2 and 3 should be combined into a single bin and EPA should establish 10,000 as the minimum number of windows.', 56: '57 O. The Pass Criteria for Engine Families Provisions Should be  Revised EPA’s proposed engine family pass criteria framework should be amended and focus more on averaging. Specifically, the initial criterion should require that at least four of the five tested engines pass; if not, at least five of the seven tested engines should be required to pass. EPA should allow (i) OEMs to take the average in each bin for each pollutant, reducing from 10 to seven the number of engines used to determine the test result and (ii) if the average of seven is above the standard that the manufacturer may elect to test more engines as such a reduction in engine number would decrease burdens on the OEM. Off-cycle standards are set far below the level at which OBD systems are able to detect emission control system malfunctions, which will contribute to a wider spectrum of results. Therefore, PACCAR supports pass/fail metrics to accommodate more non-passing engines. P. EPA Should Revise The Reporting Requirements Provisions PACCAR respectfully request that EPA revise certain aspects of its proposed reporting requirements provisions. Proposed § 1036.430(a)(3)(ix) would only authorize gaps in the 1 Hz test data file over the shift-day during analyzer zero and span verifications. This overlooks the fact that data gaps will exist when the engine is off. Any data transmitted by the engine ECU will stop when the key is off because a shut-off ECU is unable to send data. Therefore, EPA should add a “key off” condition to the list in the Agency’s proposed provision. EPA should also clarify the effect, if any, of potential data gaps. PACCAR respectfully submits that data gaps should not necessarily void a test, especially because occasionally an analyzer or measuring instrument will encounter a temporary', 57: '58 issue. Proscribing any data gaps is unrealistic and overly burdensome – as long as the minimum window count is met, the test should be valid notwithstanding potential data gaps. EPA should revise its proposal accordingly. PACCAR is also concerned with proposed § 1036.430(a)(3)(ix)(O), which currently provides: “Any parameter sensed or controlled to modulate the emission control system or fuel-injection timing.” As drafted, this provision is too broad and vague to provide regulatory certainty and enable compliance. EPA should therefore remove it. In addition, proposed § 1036.430(c) would require a number of testing and reporting notifications but the Agency has not specified the time in which such notifications must be submitted to the Designated Compliance Officer. PACCAR respectfully submits that 30 days would be a reasonable time frame in which to require OEMs to submit these notifications. In addition, EPA should remove proposed § 1036.430(c), which would require notification if two out of five tests fail because OEMs can pass with an average of ten engines. Q. The Proposed Test Procedures for Off-Cycle Testing Should be  Revised PACCAR  respectfully  submits  that  EPA  should  revised  proposed § 1036.515(b)(1). Specifically, EPA should increase the allowable maximum engine coolant temperature at start of testing to 40°C rather than 30°C. If EPA chooses not to exclude cold starts in this manner, and also chooses not to combine Bins 2 and 3, then all cold start activity should be excluded from Bin 3, and only the first cold start should be included to prevent cold-start operation from being improperly over', 58: '59 weighted during the test (i.e., successive cold starts should be excluded as should engine operation with a coolant temperature below 20°C). Moreover, data should be excluded completely or excluded from Bin 3 for five minutes post regen due to ammonia storage depletion that is caused by the regen event. IV. CONCLUSION PACCAR generally supports the goals of EPA’s Proposed Rule, including many specific elements and proposed regulatory changes. PACCAR summarizes below the major issues that EPA should take into account as it moves forward with this rulemaking: Criteria Pollutant Emission Standards: \uf0b7 PACCAR encourages EPA to adopt a single-step, technologically-feasible  rule introduced in MY 2027 to enable manufacturers to focus on the  several different development paths required for future powertrain  solutions. \uf0b7 PACCAR supports the proposed Option 2 regulatory levels (0.05 NO x ) in  laboratory controlled demonstrations, such as durability aging (DF  programs) and SEA. \uf0b7 In commerce, PACCAR requests EPA provide a “variability allowance” of  30 mg/hp-hr to address emissions variation due to the real-world  conditions and production variability. This allowance would apply to  testing engines that are acquired from field systems, such as DF  verification, and other compliance conformity testing. Useful Life: \uf0b7 PACCAR supports an extended UL demonstration in the lab, combined  with other flexibilities to reduce the UL liability in commerce and  proposes the following elements:    o Demonstration Standard:  laboratory demonstration (DF) out to  700,000 miles using accelerated aging methods o Verification of DF: in commerce out to 600,000 miles o In-Commerce Liability for Recall:  less than or equal to 600,000  miles', 59: '60 Heavy-Duty In-Use: The 3B-MAW in-use compliance protocol should be modified as follows: \uf0b7 Bins 2 and 3 should be combined \uf0b7 There should be a 10,000 window minimum in the combined bin Pass ratio: \uf0b7 4 out of 5 \uf0b7 5 out of 7 \uf0b7 Or average of 7 or more \uf0b7 Add provision to allow consultation with EPA if pass ratio is not being  met \uf0b7 Add an interim provision that allows HDIUT non-compliance to be  covered with NO X  credits Ambient temperature exclusion:  Increase threshold for the ambient temperature  exclusion proposed at -7 °C to a higher value. Warranty and Allowable Maintenance: \uf0b7 PACCAR supports EPA’s initiative to increase warranty to cover a greater  percentage of useful life (currently at 22% of UL). PACCAR supports  EPA’s proposal to extend the warranty period of at least 50% of Useful  life, and would recommend EPA align with the CARB Step 1 warranty  period of 350,000 miles (which is 58% of the proposed in-commerce  useful life of 600,000 miles). \uf0b7 In the spirit of lengthening useful life to improve long-term performance  durability, EPA should allow manufacturers to implement proactive,  predictive maintenance strategies if they proactively monitor and  identify potential maintenance issues. ABT \uf0b7 PACCAR supports EPA’s initiative to allow NO X  credit generation from  ZEVs. \uf0b7 EPA should also allow vehicle manufacturers to provide incentives to  their customers to trade in their older vehicles for new technology  vehicles, after which manufacturers should be allowed to bank NO X credits proportional to one year of service for eliminating the trade-in  vehicle from the population.', 60: '61 GHG Phase 2 \uf0b7 PACCAR does not support the re-opening of the GHG Phase 2 rule,  specifically because the standards are set to take effect in MY2027. PACCAR appreciates the opportunity to provide comments and will continue to work with EPA on defining a fair and feasible standard.

{0: 'Suncor Energy Inc.   |   Climate Report 2022   |    4 Navigating the energy transition – Meeting ambition with action For several years, we have witnessed unprecedented market  volatility – from oil market oversupply and negative prices in 2020  to shortages and soaring prices today, in energy and non-energy  commodities. It is estimated that a record 13% of global GDP will  be spent on primary energy demand in 2022. 1  A culmination of  factors – underinvestment in oil and gas, public anxiety about  climate change, challenges to developing large projects, a global  pandemic, inflation, geopolitical conflicts and war – have brought  to light issues of emissions, energy security, affordability and  social well-being. This volatility and the impact on people have underscored the  tension between our current energy system and where we need  to be to achieve net-zero commitments. Recent events have raised  awareness about the attributes of different sources of energy,  highlighting that while carbon is a key measure, it is only one  aspect of performance. Hence, we maintain that Canadian oil  has unparalleled potential to help ensure long-term, dependable  and affordable supplies of energy for the world as we collectively  transition to a net-zero economy. We firmly believe these objectives  are complementary, not contradictory. We need a thoughtful and balanced energy transition, supported  by adequate investment and conducive regulations. Despite  an accelerated pace of technology and innovation, the world is  struggling to scale solutions. Development of opportunities like  renewable energy, hydrogen and CCUS are hampered by challenging  economics, complex regulatory environments, and system capacity  and timing concerns – along with surging input costs, geopolitical  and supply chain risks, and environmental and social impacts of  their own. This has resulted in a build-up of capital but a relative  shortage of opportunities and, hence, meaningful progress in adequate project development. This trend must change. To provide  attractive returns to global investors, our collective effort as industry,  governments and the financial community is to create an attractive  fiscal and regulatory environment that puts willing capital to work on  strong energy-transition projects. Encouragingly, record outflows of capital away from energy are  slowly reversing, with a growing sentiment amongst leading  investors that divesting oil and gas is counteractive to overall  success. Traditional energies are fundamental to building the new  energy economy – as a way of financing and fuelling new systems  and as an essential part of the future mix, according to leading  forecasts. Projects like the Pathways Alliance proposed carbon  trunkline and sequestration hub and our partnership with ATCO  on a world-leading hydrogen facility are the types of projects we  are investing in today that can begin to reliably transition us to  the low-carbon energies of tomorrow, within a decade. This is  transition in action. While the combined global events of the past few years may have  been the most volatile in Suncor’s history, they have reinforced our  purpose. Our strategy positions us well to navigate the complex  dynamics of energy markets and the energy transition, motivating  us to optimize and transform our current assets. It allows us to  use our strengths and capabilities to expand into exciting business  lines that deepen our connection with consumers, while delivering  on our shareholder commitments. As we envision our energy  future, we aim to demonstrate leadership in sustainability and  the energy transition and will focus our efforts on environmental  success, social well-being and making real progress toward shared  objectives. All of these are interrelated and driven by secure,  reliable and affordable energy. 1 Rob West, “Conclusions from March 2022: Rescuing the Energy Transition,” Thunder Said Energy Research Note, Electronic mail, April 1, 2022.
