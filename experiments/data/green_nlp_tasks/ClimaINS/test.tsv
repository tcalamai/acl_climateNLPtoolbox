i) the scope of process:
At AIG PC, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance

We have an integrated, multi-disciplinary process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material, risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather

To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate PML (probable maximum loss), monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change

ii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:
Risks or opportunities related to climate change are assessed at the company level through a multi-layered risk management organizational structure  AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Finance and Risk Management Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board  Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimizing intrinsic value, and protecting AIGs reputation among key stakeholders The management committees that support the GRC are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates, and are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries
	
AIG PC considers climate change as it relates to future risk exposures through an Environmental Working Group (EWG), made up of senior staff from across the organization, including Enterprise Risk Management Following assessments of recent natural catastrophes, AIG recognizes the impact of environmental change on the risk profile The EWG was established to develop a framework for AIG PC to establish a view on the impact and risk of anthropogenic environmental change and its impact on AIGs business This includes better understanding what the climate science indicates about changes to the environment and a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile

An example of a climate change-related (non-hurricane) risk identification and analysis currently being undertaken by AIG PCs Catastrophe Management and Analytics Center of Excellence is the Climate Informed Global Flood Risk Assessment  The project is developing innovative modeling frameworks for local and global flood risk estimation, and supporting them through the integration of rainfall simulation, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, statistical models, key topography, asset, population density, climate and other socio-economic data bases This will provide a robust platform for the best possible flood risk estimates in a changing climate for actuarial and portfolio analysis using all information sources as they are updated  The project methodology will be applied to several global regions where recent mega-floods have led to concerns, and test the predictive analysis by focusing on key attributes of different settings of interest The model is also intended to assess the financial impacts of flooding of assets at risk within the region(s) for which policies are written, or whose disruption (eg, transportation networks) would result in business disruption or loss of use claims

iii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level, but the AIG PC EWG is comprised of members from throughout AIGs individual asset levels and business units who may elevate relevant climate-change related risk information up to the enterprise risk level for assessment as appropriate

At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events In fact, the impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

iv) the frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):
Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) The AIG PC Environmental Working Group monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including identifying climate change related risks and opportunities

v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIGs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer

At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events In fact, the impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets
iv) the frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):
Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) The AIG PC Environmental Working Group monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including identifying climate change related risks and opportunities
v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit
vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIG's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer"	1274	en	mild gibberish

The actual level and type of risk assessment employed in each situation depends on many factors: the nature of the risk, its materiality to Chubb, the quality of the data, the underlying facts and science and, finally, potential actions post-assessment Quantification typically involves an assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence, analysis of Chubbs exposures (eg underwriting limits deployed, counter-party exposure) relative to risk measures (eg earnings, capital, liquidity, industry market share) and other considerations, such as collateral Specific examples of risk assessment measures utilized are accumulation and scenario These analyses may be supported by other activities including analytics, claims, actuarial, legal, investments and underwriting

Chubb is a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and closely monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its global portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities, including where and how we might be able to offer coverage to consumers and businesses in areas exposed to natural perils Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a framework to think about how changes in short- and long-term frequency should be factored into its risk management systems Standard & Poors rated Chubbs ERM process Strong in its June 2018 ERM Rating Report, placing Chubb among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurers Chubb invests to continually upgrade and refine its risk management tools for catastrophes such as floods and hurricanes Chubb accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur where Chubb has offices Severe weather events have tested Chubbs Business Continuity Program and operations have functioned effectively Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss (PML) calculation)

Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, we focus on non-modeled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We continue to invest in developing and refining tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for Chubb The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesnt anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by Chubbs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for Chubb"	2	"Risk assessment flows sequentially from risk identification and is performed by executive-level risk owners and business management both, routinely, as part of day-to-day activities through ad-hoc analyses and, formally, with an annual assessment of the inherent nature of the risk, key controls and any emerging issues

As noted in our response to question two:

In 2017, Sun Life Investment Management(1) began developing a formal climate change investment strategy as a part of codifying the asset management businesss stand-alone sustainability principles for addressing non-financial risks/issues in both our business practices and investment management operations

As a part of our current investment process, we incorporate ESG factors for assessing investment risks We evaluate each investment on many factors, including risk, return, capital treatment, diversification, and how it fits with our role as a steward of policyholder and shareholder funds

In 2017, we convened a task force composed of our public and private fixed income investment teams to: (i) assess our existing portfolio investments in coal, oil sands producers and related industries such as railways and pipelines (collectively referred to as Targeted Industries) from both an economic
and headline risk perspective; and (ii) recommend parameters for future investments in such Targeted Industries both as the company exists today and over the term of the investment in consideration

As national and sub-national GHG reduction commitments and cap and trade schemes are increasingly introduced, further investment opportunities may emerge for Sun Life Sun Lifes more than 30 years of experience in clean and renewable energy investment in its Project Finance Investments area could present additional investment opportunities for the Company We believe there will be a growing demand for efficient public transit infrastructure, and there will be an opportunity to provide lending on such developments Similarly, GHG emissions regulation could present an opportunity through increased demand for Sun Lifes real estate developments that meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or other environmental standards LEED Green Building Rating System encourages and accelerates global adoption of sustainable building and development practices LEED is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high-performing green buildings We aspire to make LEED compliance part of our investment criteria and we have a number of real estate investments which have received, or are in the process of obtaining, LEED certifications 
We also participate in other industry programs which monitor the environmental profile of our buildings For example, Sun Life participates in Building Environmental Standards (BESt) program, which is the Canadian environmental program managed by Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) The program recognizes excellence in environmental management and performance and under the program all buildings undergo a third party verification review before achieving any of the four levels of BOMA BESt certification A number of our real estate investments have received BOMA BESt certification

A 2015 study commissioned by our subsidiary Bentall Kennedy Group provided empirical evidence that sustainable buildings provide better returns to owners through higher occupancy levels, higher rental rates and lower rent concessions (Please see Devine, A, & Kok, N (2015) Green Certification and Building Performance: Implications for Tangibles and Intangibles The Journal of Portfolio Management, Special Real Estate Issue)

") as part of its risk management and underwriting process The company supplements this process with research into climate change and its economic impact The process is led by three units within Swiss Re, mentioned in question 2:

-   Sustainability & Political Risk Management coordinates Swiss Re's climate change engagement including our program of climate risk research 

-    Emerging Risk Management coordinates the identification, assessment, and monitoring of new or emerging risks, including climate-related risks They recently concluded an assessment of the company's potential exposure to losses arising from climate litigation, with a focus on the United States, and Swiss Re continues to monitor this issue on a quarterly basis Further climate related areas which have been assessed are heat waves, drought and wildfires

-    Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and floodingThis unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions and the latest scientific knowledge, the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings into our risk models and underwriting processes 

The Sustainability & Political Risk Management and Catastrophe Perils units collaborate closely on our ongoing program of research devoted to enhance our understanding of climate related risk and to assess the economic impacts of climate change on our portfolio of business  When this research generates valuable quantitative data, it is integrated into the company's risk management processes  

Swiss Re has also implemented an internal platform in its property & casualty business units called ""SONAR"" This initiative is designed to systematically screen evolving risks and changes in the risk landscape SONAR is a structure for the exchange of observations associated with risk among different countries, cultures, and offices throughout the Swiss Re Group  SONAR thus helps to improve understanding of Swiss Re's future exposure by reducing the degree of uncertainty related to future risks, including climate change risks

Swiss Re does not have a separate policy for the management of climate risks in relation to its investment activities Instead the investment process is focused on addressing a broader spectrum of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues related to the investments See question 5 for more information 

Swiss Re has entered several strategic groups to exchange knowledge on risk issues including climate  For example, Swiss Re is a member of the Chief Risk Officers Forum Emerging Risk Initiative, which strives to present the insurance industry's shared position on emerging risks, and the company is a partner of the Global Risk Network of the World Economic Forum, contributing to its Global Risks Report  Swiss Re is also a founding member of ClimateWise, an insurance industry platform to assess climate change risk A former CEO of Swiss Re is Chairman of ClimateWise and the company also serves on the Management Board 

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies  The findings of ECA research are made available on a country-by-country basis on our website, in addition to our print publications, and we continue to update this as new findings become available  Swiss Re was closely involved in a new project incorporating the ECA approach working together with New York City See (chapter 2):

- Swiss Re's Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and floodingThis unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions and the latest scientific knowledge, the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings into our risk models and underwriting processes
The Sustainability & Political Risk Management and Catastrophe Perils units collaborate closely on our ongoing program of research devoted to enhance our understanding of climate related risk and to assess the economic impacts of climate change on our portfolio of business When this research generates valuable quantitative data, it is integrated into the company's risk management processes
Swiss Re has also implemented an internal platform in its property & casualty business units called ""SONAR"" This initiative is designed to systematically screen evolving risks and changes in the risk landscape SONAR is a structure for the exchange of observations associated with risk among different countries, cultures, and offices throughout the Swiss Re Group SONAR thus helps to improve understanding of Swiss Re's future exposure by reducing the degree of uncertainty related to future risks, including climate change risks
Swiss Re does not have a separate policy for the management of climate risks in relation to its investment activities Instead the investment process is focused on addressing a broader spectrum of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues related to the investments See question 5 for more information
Swiss Re has entered several strategic groups to exchange knowledge on risk issues including climate For example, Swiss Re is a member of the Chief Risk Officers Forum Emerging Risk Initiative, which strives to present the insurance industry's shared position on emerging risks, and the company is a partner of the Global Risk Network of the World Economic Forum, contributing to its Global Risks Report Swiss Re is also a founding member of ClimateWise, an insurance industry platform to assess climate change risk A former CEO of Swiss Re is Chairman of ClimateWise and the company also serves on the Management Board
Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies The findings of ECA research are made available on a country-by-country basis on our website, in addition to our print publications, and we continue to update this as new findings become available Swiss Re was closely involved in a new project incorporating the ECA approach working together with New York City See (chapter 2):

" This could result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks could become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Severe weather related events of concern, such as hurricanes and severe thunderstorm/tornados, are localized, short-term weather related events that are a second order impact of a warming global climate While it is logical to assume that a warmer climate would increase the amount of atmospheric energy available for the formation of localized, short-term severe weather events, the precise impact to the frequency and severity of such events relative to historical levels is uncertain 

Increases in property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest themselves gradually over a period of many years (decades), while policies are typically of one-year duration This allows Liberty Mutual the opportunity to adjust rates, coverages and underwriting guidelines as required in response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophe events The Company will continue to closely monitor trends in catastrophe loss frequency and severity, and to employ the latest generation of computer modeling tools to estimate exposures to natural catastrophe events, adjust pricing and underwriting guidelines as necessary 

Future pricing must be sufficiently flexible and continuously incorporate the latest trend data and scientific advances in catastrophe modeling to ensure adequate risk adjusted returns on capital A significant concern is the potential for a wide divergence in the future between the consensus view of natural catastrophe risk between insurers and the regulators with authority to approve changes to pricing Many current regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and in effect set price controls that are slow to react to changes in risk levels Should the Company be unable to raise rates consistent with any increases in natural catastrophe risk, the only viable strategic option may be to significantly restrict the amount of business written in certain markets, or possibly to exit certain markets altogether

The geographical areas impacted by climate change risk are generally those that are currently at the greatest risk for the natural catastrophe perils described above (eg, the East Coast and Gulf for hurricane, and the Central and Southern US for tornado/severe thunderstorm) Any increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes may expand the boundaries of the geographic areas that are susceptible to each peril, but the areas indicated above are likely to continue to be of highest risk"	3	"This could result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks could become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Our plans to mitigate emissions in operations and organization include:

-	Encouraging our policyholders to utilize electronic means of transacting business with the confines of state approved procedures Electronic transactions mean a smaller environmental footprint

-	Ensuring energy efficiency in the facilities we utilize The group has facilities in Manhattan, NY and Roanoke, Virginia The building in which the companys Manhattan  office  is located, at 100 west 33rd street, is certified by US Green Building Council as meeting the GOLD standard for LEED 2009 Existing Buildings Operations and Maintenance The building received very high marks for energy efficiency (both on-site and offsite renewable energy), emissions reduction reporting and solid waste management The emissions footprint of the building was a consideration in its selection The group recently added a second location in Roanoke, VA, and took steps in the design of that space to address energy efficiency This includes meeting ASHRAE (The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) guidelines for ventilation and filtration, programmable thermostats, and HVAC duct design for even distribution of air flow


-	Encouraging work from home arrangements for its workforce, and mass transit use for those working out of its Manhattan office The majority of employees working out of the Manhattan office use mass transit to commute; the group has commuter savings programs and it has picked a location that was conducive to using mass transit Videoconferencing is extensively used to connect remote sites for meetings Finally, the group   has work from home programs which help reduce emissions

-	Co-sharing a data center The groups data center was moved to a shared location in North Carolina Sharing of space and resources helps reduce emissions The data center provider is one of the top 30 tech and telecom companies in the EPAs Green Power Partner Program The data center was designed and built with a focus on effectiveness and efficiency This practice helps minimize the depletion of resources and maximizes infrastructure capacities to support our business needs One example is the implementation of smart cooling solutions that leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics The data center also purchases green power where it is available and competitively priced to support green power production By carefully attending to these elements, we minimize our carbon footprint

-	Minimizing printing of marketing materials The company digitizes much of its marketing collateral This means that agents only use materials as needed and additional emissions are not created in overstocking materials

Next, the group will research ways of accounting for its emissions production Once we have a benchmark, we will consider ways of reducing our emissions

" Environmental risks, including those associated with climate change, is also now an explicit risk, within Cignas enterprise risk register, which is formally reviewed on a quarterly basis

We consider a range of potential opportunities driven by physical climate risks, including changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns and sea levels Specifically, we consider the potential for changes in physical climate parameters to present a broader series of global public health challenges, such as those relating to (1) extreme weather events, (2) decreases in water supply, (3) heat exposure, and (4) declining crop yields In the short-term, extreme weather events have been prioritized as our greatest physical risk

We also consider how changes in physical and transition risks could also influence a series of socioeconomic challenges and opportunities that would likely impact the delivery of healthcare Examples could include health and hygiene issues due to migration, malnutrition, and increases in respiratory, bronchial, water-borne and other diseases Additionally, we consider how these negative societal and environmental impacts could present opportunities where Cigna, in particular, could provide products and services to help respond to these changes in physical climate parameters across the markets we serve 

The findings from considering both qualitative and qualitative scenarios related to climate change have influenced our business strategy and planning process through our (1) establishment of environmental targets, (2) identification of emissions reduction projects to support our targets, (3) pursuit of LEED® certification and ENERGY STAR® building ratings, and (4) investments in onsite renewable energy where we expect to generate and sell renewable energy credits

We consider all geographic locations and markets where we operate in addition to potential new markets under evaluation Additionally, we consider global environmental and socioeconomic trends, which may impact the value of our assets in addition to revenue and costs in our target markets In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which include investors, corporate customers and industry peers

For example, based on the processes and considerations as described above, we have identified transition risks associated the variability in energy costs and increased stakeholder interest in climate change and broader environmental, social and governance performance As a result, increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations We also have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions We have also identified extreme weather events  notably hurricanes in the United States  as our greatest current physical climate risk To deliver on our mission, we must be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail As such, we invest resources in Cignas Customer Disaster Response Program and Business Continuity and Data Center Recovery plans

Cignas mission is to improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind of the people we serve As such, we make the connection between personal health and the health of our environment To support our mission, we are focused on (1) reducing our energy, emissions and overall environmental footprint; (2) reusing and recycling more of what we consume; (3) increasing efficiencies in all our operations; and (4) engaging with our customers and key stakeholders to support our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility platform Additionally, our Enterprise Risk Management qualitative considerations include factors such as achieving shareholder value, strategy alignment with overall mission and vision, and reputation and brand impact

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg, coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest loss simulation models from catastrophe modeling firms AIR Worldwide and Risk Management Solutions As part of its natural catastrophe modeling and exposure management, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe loss exposure 

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the loss simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual can estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, sidecars, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools, and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models With regard to climate change, the R&D team has historically focused on models for hurricanes and severe convective storms, which comprise the majority of the Companys natural catastrophe exposure The R&D team continues to evaluate the credibility of new modeling methodology for perils, such as wildfire, as they become available All model methodologies are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures

When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty Mutual reviews the warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog alongside the standard long-term historical catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee

Governance
Manulife is committed to conducting our business in a manner that recognizes the need to preserve the quality of our environment  Manulifes Environmental Policy states that we will ensure that our risk analysis and management procedures will include consideration of environmental matters, which includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  To support this, Manulifes Environmental Risk Policy applies to all business units with environmental exposure and any business or entity in which Manulife holds an equity position and the right to select, control and direct management and operations

Our Environmental Risk Policy requires business units, through their Business Unit Environmental Officers, to report annually to the Chief Environmental Officer their GHG emissions performance data and identify risks and opportunities as a result of climate change  GHG emissions data are measured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and are consolidated at the company level and used for reporting in Manulifes Public Accountability Statement, submissions to the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and various other reports throughout the year  These assessments allow the company to formulate plans to reduce or mitigate emissions in an effective manner

We have been making submissions to the CDP since 2005 and our most recent submission is publicly available on the CDPs website

Performance
Manulife has invested in systems that collect energy use and other environmental data, which allow us to set environmental targets and monitor our performance  
In 2016, we launched a new Sustainable Real Estate Policy that applies to our real estate investment, development, asset and property management activities across our global operations We have a 2 per cent year-over-year energy use reduction target in our real estate operations, which has helped us achieve a 24 per cent reduction in the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions since 2012 We are pleased to report that nearly 26 million square feet, or 41 percent of our real estate portfolio, is certified to sustainable building standard such as LEED or Energy Star

We continue to purchase renewable energy credits as a way of demonstrating our commitment to the transition to a lower carbon economy and in 2016, we purchased 29,245 MWh of renewable energy

Manulife is also reducing its emissions directly and indirectly through a number of other ongoing environmental initiatives:  

We sustainably manage approximately 24 million hectares of forests on behalf of our General Account fund and third-party investors  All eligible forestry operations are certified to independent third-party standards for environmental stewardship such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative These working forests play an important role in mitigating and managing the impacts of climate change We plant more than two trees for every tree harvested and 2016 was a milestone year, marking the planting of our billionth tree

We invest considerably in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects  Since 2002, we have invested C$109 billion in projects that either provide clean, renewable energy or reduce energy consumption

" However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources In 2007, prior to ACEs January 2016 acquisition of The Chubb Corporation and adoption of the Chubb name, ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal While the EPAs program was discontinued in late 2011, its methodology was based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis  Chubb still actively uses this methodology today Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006 to 2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule with a total reduction of 30% per employee Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide greenhouse gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 Through 2015, ACE reduced global GHG emissions by 5% per employee from 2012 A new GHG reduction goal will be announced to reflect the combined companys real estate footprint and GHG inventory 

To achieve our GHG reduction goal, Chubb will aggressively work to make reductions within the organization The majority of Chubbs emissions  approximately 70%  result from electricity use (data centers, plug loads, lighting, etc) and stationary combustion (oil/natural gas) by our offices As a result, Chubbs Corporate Environmental Program focuses primarily on reducing our energy consumption at the facility level  specifically, in our owned buildings and larger, long-term leased spaces In 2017, Chubb voluntarily implemented several building efficiency projects including installation of new HVAC equipment, LED lighting as well as Building Automation System (BAS) upgrades and installation Due to green building efforts, Chubbs Philadelphia building has reduced energy consumption more than 20% since 2006 through the installation of new boilers, LED lighting, efficient ventilation equipment and variable speed drive HVAC equipment The building earned LEED Silver certification through the US Green Building Council in August 2009 and, in November 2014, achieved Gold certification In July 2011, the companys Bermuda office earned LEED Gold certification due in large part to re-lamping of office lights, applying a floating temperature set point and installing motion sensors and timers on office equipment These actions reduced electrical needs by approximately 500,000 kilowatt-hours (358 metric tons of CO2e) per year In early 2017, Chubbs Bermuda office recertified to Gold using the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool that continuously monitors and encourages improvement of overall building performance Chubb furthered its commitment to reducing emissions by earning Energy Star designations for the Wilmington, Del, Philadelphia, Pa and Whitehouse Station, NJ offices in 2016 Also in 2014, Chubb created a targeted energy policy for its operations in Europe, a region that includes 19 countries The policy aims to reduce GHG emissions by establishing building energy benchmarking and pursuing short-term objectives that reduce energy consumption within the region As part of this policy, Chubb has conducted an energy audit at the London, UK office, for example, and identified GHG reduction opportunities that were implemented in 2015 Similar efforts were completed in several other owned and long-term leased offices including Monterrey, Mexico, the Chubb Conference Center and ACE Club, and Whitehouse Station, NJ  Energy conservation measures discovered from these energy audits are implemented in order to reduce GHG emissions from these buildings  

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption Chubb also manages its flight-related emissions by operating ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow Chubbs aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, Chubb reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world Chubbs 2017 submission to the CDP resulted in a score of A-"	0	"However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources In 2007, prior to ACE's January 2016 acquisition of The Chubb Corporation and adoption of the Chubb name, ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal While the EPA's program was discontinued in late 2011, its methodology was based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis Chubb still actively uses this methodology today Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006 to 2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule with a total reduction of 30% per employee Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide greenhouse gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 Through 2015, ACE reduced global GHG emissions by 5% per employee from 2012 A new GHG reduction goal will be announced to reflect the combined company's real estate footprint and GHG inventory

"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED ranking, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Humanas short-term strategy (<3 years) is influenced by climate change most notably with regard to our environmental goals, set to expire at the end of 2017 These goals influence our team to focus on energy efficient operations, spurring direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned and leased facilities These investments have enabled Humana to implement a portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit program and other projects to increase the efficient use of energy at our facilities In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations Overall, our facility portfolio efforts have resulted in over $18MM in cost savings, 65,000 MMBtu in energy reduction, and nearly 11,000 mt CO2e GHG reduction  Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities By the end of 2015, nearly 50,000 sq ft of traditional space was converted to agile work space at eight locations, while 34% of Humanas employees worked from home by the end of 2016

Our long-term strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Workplace Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

" SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

3 Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 2001-2002 (71%) to 2013-2014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: ""Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems"""	1100	en	clean

Zurich is mindful of its environmental impact and in 2008 set itself a global target to reduce carbon emissions per employee by 10 percent by 2013 as compared to a 2007 baseline Zurich reached the original carbon reduction target ahead of schedule and has since extended its carbon reduction target with a goal to decrease carbon emissions per employee from its office buildings, and business travel by 50 percent by 2020 as compared to the 2007 baseline As of the end of 2014, Zurich has decreased carbon emissions per employee 37%  Additionally, Zurich has also reached its target to become carbon neutral as of the end of 2014 through its ambitious internal carbon reduction target and offsetting any remaining emissions through a forestry project in Indonesia, which is supporting Zurichs flood resilience program  Zurich aims to achieve their carbon emission reduction target  by reducing energy consumption, continuing to increase onsite generation and purchase of renewable energy and decreasing emissions from business travel by encouraging video- and teleconferencing and providing incentives to use public transportation  

In 2014, Zurich has switched its North America headquarters in Schaumburg, IL over to 100% green electricity (100% wind power) through electricity provider contracts, resulting in an increase in renewable power for its United States operations 53% as compared to the 2007 baseline

In addition to purchasing energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, Zurich has set the global target of reducing energy consumption per employee 40% by 2020 As of the end of 2014, Zurich has reduced energy consumption per employee by 30% Zurich aims to reach its global energy reduction target by implementing effective energy management programs such as replacing older technology lighting with retrofit products that easily fit into existing fixtures and making adjustments and observations by following the Facilities Management Carbon Footprint 30 Point Reduction Plan Some programs implemented at the Schaumburg, IL headquarters include reductions to HVAC and UPS loads in the server room, as data center equipment has migrated to our 3rd party supplier; and improved parking lot lighting control for one of the two towers, moving the loads to the building automation system 
Zurich continues to follow this trend by striving for LEED Platinum certification of their new North America headquarters currently being developed in Schaumburg, IL 

In addition to these improvements, Zurich has also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Zurich continues to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Zurich has completed the first year of a 3 year project to reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within their office buildings from 2,106 to 1,280 machines (39% reduction) and replace the remaining 61% with more energy efficient equipment, projecting an energy cost savings of $70,61200, 470,746 KWh and 324 tonnes of CO2 over a 3 year period In 2014, Zurich developed and implemented a Group-wide environmental management system (EMS), which builds on and integrates existing activities throughout the Group Beyond goals of reducing its global carbon footprint, the new system also addresses other areas of environmental impact in office buildings, mainly paper use, water consumption and waste generation  Zurichs EMS has been certified ISO 14001 for their Swiss operations See more about Zurichs Environmental Protection at the link below:

In 2008, Zurich set its first global environmental target to reduce carbon emissions per employee by 10 percent by 2013 as compared to a 2007 baseline Zurich exceeded the original carbon reduction target in 2012 Following, Zurich set new environmental targets including a 50 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 40 percent reduction in energy per employee, by 2020 compared to a 2007 baseline In 2016, Zurich exceeded these targets achieving a 53 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 43 percent reduction in energy per employee In 2017 Zurich committed to further long-term environmental targets to be achieved by 2025 against a 2015 baseline  Those targets include Zurich achieving and maintaining a 20% reduction in total carbon emissions per employee, broken down by facilities and business travel emissions, as well as a 20% reduction in energy per employee 

See June 29, 2017 news release: https://wwwzurichcom/en/media/news-releases/2017/2017-0629-01

Additionally, Zurich has been carbon neutral since 2014, investing in the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, a REDD+ project validated under the Verified Carbon Standard 

Zurich has achieved these substantial improvements in environmental performance through the following key programs:
	Purchasing renewable electricity wherever economically and operationally feasible
	Sustainable buildings  Addressing the full building life-cycle, Zurich considers sustainability starting at the selection of our buildings (eg green leasing), through construction and office fit-out projects (eg sustainable project management guidelines), and during day-to-day operations (eg sustainable facilities management practices) 
	Efficient travel practices  only traveling when necessary and using video and teleconference wherever possible instead Zurich encourages the transition to a more sustainable car fleet
	Zurichs workplace strategy program ensures our office space considers evolving workplace trends, enabling the delivery of collaborative, fit-for-purpose work environments, while delivering space efficiency improvements 


In 2014, Zurich started sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at its North America headquarters in Schaumburg, IL They continued with this commitment at the newly constructed LEED Platinum headquarters which opened in the fall of 2016 As of 2017, Zurich North America sourced 47 percent renewable electricity out of its total electricity demand, while globally, 54 percent of Zurichs electricity comes from renewable sources

In addition to purchasing renewable electricity, the new LEED Platinum headquarters boasts a number of best practice examples in sustainable building including: a curtain wall system designed to maximize natural light; a system to provide high-quality indoor air; access to public transportation and accommodations for electric and low-emitting vehicles; incorporation of multiple green roofs, totaling more than one acre; landscape including 637 trees and more than 13 acres of native savannah plantings; walking paths and water features; rainwater harvest and re-use; recycling and reduction of waste during construction process and efforts to utilize locally-sourced building materials

In addition, Zurich has also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Zurich continues to work on reducing its impact from paper and printing Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Zurich has implemented a Managed Document Service (MDS) optimization program, reducing the total number of multi-functional devices (MFDs) , and replacing the remaining fleet with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also deliver significant operational cost savings  As of 2017, the number of MFDs within our North America office buildings has been reduced to 272 machines from 438 in 2013  (a 38% reduction)

"  More details on the computer modeling are included in question 8  
In addition the ERM team regularly reviews pertinent scientific literature to ensure it understands current thinking on how climate change is impacting the perils that could currently or in future give rise to losses  
While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear  For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought  To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP
http://rogerpielkejrblogspotcom/2013/03/graph-of-day-global-disasters-and-gdphtml
Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household  Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils  This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA  Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes  
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34%  
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes  The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devises have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported  However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 show no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5   Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment  However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood   If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones line Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP
Measures such as the annual mean US runoff and the percentage of streamages above bankful streamflow show no upward trend  Flood losses taken from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): http://wwwnwsnoaagov/hic/:
Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s  During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, but there is no evidence of any long-term change related to climate   
National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry:  data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US National Percent Area Severely to Extremely Dry and Severely to Extremely Wet, wwwncdcnoaagov/oa/climate/research/2003/dec/uspctarea-wetdrytxt
When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period  NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries   In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA  These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s)
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance  Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage
Wildfire
The chart below shows acres burned per year from 1931 to 2003  It considers only protected land; if we consider all acres burned there is a very material decreasing trend   http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period  There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought
Based on an analysis of the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS)  wildfire losses from 1990 to 2012, on average less than 5% of the market total insured losses arise from commercial insurance  There has been no discernable trend in the share of PCS losses arising from commercial property over this period  This broader market data mirrors our own experience; Berkley companies have not seen significant losses in our own portfolio arising from wildfire events
We continue to monitor the composition of PCS losses, and our own losses as a share on PCS loss by peril, to ensure that should the current situation change we can take appropriate actions  At present, however, wildfire is not significant to us from an insured loss perspective

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through
(1) our emissions reduction projects and 
(2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2014, we completed 13 emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and replacements of aging infrastructure   We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles  To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to Energy Star ratings  These management methods, most notably our investments in emissions reduction projects, have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next five years

Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)-- Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets  Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail    Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster     Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods for the risk of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) include the following:  
(1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol 

(2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication

(3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes

(4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk   These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years

Risk: Reputation--Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones   Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders We will continue to monitor their key concerns and areas of greatest interest through stakeholder materiality assessments 

Management Method: Management methods include the following:  
(1) Within our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued emission reductions investments to support this energy strategy and 2017 emissions reduction targets

(2) The advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives 

(3) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility 

(4) We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports In 2014, Cignas published its first Corporate Responsibility Report using the GRIs G4 guidelines  We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years

When considering individual investments as well as the aggregate amount of investment categories the Companies consider risks beyond the traditional investing frameworks of credit worthiness and growth potential A holistic approach to investment risk considers political, macroeconomic, environmental and potential correlations with other risks the Companies accept For example, climate risk is often associated with underwriting risks that the Companies manage with geographic concentration analysis and reinsurance A large loss may impact the Companies underwriting results, reinsurance collectability, the credit quality of a reinsurers bonds and the value of the reinsurers equity Similarly, societal initiatives to reduce carbon emission may impact private or municipally owned electric utilities as well as global demand for fossil fuels which may impact asset values

The potential for climate change risk impacting the portfolio is addressed holistically and not isolated to a particular investment type  Accordingly, all of the Companies risk monitoring beginning with asset allocation through individual asset purchase limits assists with monitoring each individual risk

The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which holds that all known risks are discounted in the current price of an asset, adequately discounts risks such as climate change by the pricing mechanism inherent within capital markets  Risks such as climate change are discounted within the price of an individual asset

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to improve its carbon footprint From an original investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology for cooling its buildings, to upgrading building fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, replacing much of its florescent lighting with efficient LED lighting, and the installation of white roofs on buildings to lower heating and cooling requirements, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption During 2017, The Hanover has undertaken a multi- million dollar project to replace over 300 single pane windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its Headquarters (HQ) facility in Worcester, Massachusetts The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the past eight consecutive years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines In addition, for the past seven consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed on The Hanovers 800K square foot HQ campus and a total of over 80% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers 14M square foot office portfolio is offset by certified Renewable Energy Certificates   

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively divert approximately 40% of the total waste stream at its HQ facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions At its HQ facility, The Hanover partnered with Mass-Rides, a ride-matching service sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which rewards employees for walking, biking, telecommuting, carpooling, vanpooling, taking transit, or working a compressed week With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our HQ facility With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work schedules which allow many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our roadways For these efforts, The Hanover continuously earns the ECO Leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well   

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most important, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint We have also witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced a material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and who challenge The Hanover to do even more

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders For example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

Liberty Mutual engages its policyholders in several ways to address climate change The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events

"S Nationwide and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness, main-street and middle-market commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency

Nationwide faces several potential business risks associated with climate change including:

	Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;
	Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics; 
	Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas; 
	Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)
As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

Potentially Impacted Geographies: Nationwide companies have property exposures in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the entire geography is subject to some potential consequence of climate change Nationwides Life and Retirement Solutions exposures also include all 50 states and the District of Columbia 
"	3	"S Nationwide and its subsidiaries write personal, agribusiness, main-street and middle-market commercial property casualty insurance, as well as life insurance and retirement solution products Nationwide stays abreast of the most recent scientific studies and findings with regard to climate change Currently, the consensus opinion by the scientific community on observed trends is that tropical cyclones, extropical cyclones (winter storms), and severe thunderstorms will increase in intensity while decreasing in frequency due to climate change Wildfires and floods are expected to increase in both intensity and frequency
Nationwide faces several potential business risks associated with climate change including:
* Potential volatility in results due to possible increased frequency and/or severity of weather-related catastrophic losses;
* Regulatory constraints on charging appropriate rates that take into account possible weather changes and related losses that are not reflected by historical statistics;
* Market share of business being adversely impacted due to a disproportionate growth of population and property along coastal areas;
* Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
* Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the company's business and
* Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)
As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

"  Below is a sample of the ways we have altered our investment strategy across various asset classes in response to analyzing the impacts of climate change:
Fixed income
Manulife manages a large, long-tenor, investment-grade fixed income debt portfolio to support our product guarantees in our life insurance policies and other products  As part of this investment program, we try to evaluate all risks to the performance of this portfolio over its life, including climate change

With respect to power and energy investments, we remain alert as to how climate risk is affecting power and energy companies over the long term  Our investor position as a senior lender to many of the diversified power and energy companies that will probably be most acutely affected gives us some investment protection from financial pressures that could emerge as these companies work to adapt to a lower carbon future

We have also altered our fixed income investment strategy to take advantage of the market opportunities presented by climate change and the environment For example, regulatory initiatives launched in certain jurisdictions in response to climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements have created programs and policies to encourage renewable energy projects  These government initiatives have created new opportunities for our project finance investment areas and as a result, our renewable power project financing has grown considerably over the past decade  Since 2002, Manulifes aggregate total investment in renewable power and energy efficiency projects exceeds C$109 billion

Private equity
Similar to our fixed income investments, we remain alert as to how climate risk is affecting power and energy companies over the long term and we monitor the changing operating landscape while capitalizing on new investment opportunities presented by changing regulation enticing the development of renewable energy  As an example, our subsidiary Regional Power which develops, owns and operates hydroelectric facilities in Canada, is now expanding into other types of renewable energy production because of expanded market opportunities as a result of regulatory changes

Natural resources investments
The investment strategy of our Hancock Natural Resource Group (HNRG) subsidiary, which invests in farms, timberland and renewable energy from biomass, gives consideration to the potential physical impacts of climate change  HNRG evaluates potential land holdings from a long-term investment perspective (ie 20+ years), and thus we have enhanced our due diligence and are looking to focus our acquisitions in geographies where water availability is conducive to value growth over several decades and other climate-influenced natural forces such as pests and fire do not militate against investment  In addition, the Hancock Renewable Energy Group (HREG) is pursuing acquisitions and investment in the waste and bio-energy sectors Investments include conversion facilities that utilize biomass from forest and agricultural lands and other waste streams HREG provides institutional investors with the opportunity to invest in carbon offset and low carbon impact projects  Since 2011, HREG has invested US$300 million in renewable energy projects

Real estate investments
Market demand for more sustainable buildings has altered our investment and capital improvement strategy in our real estate investments  We are increasingly looking to invest in LEED certified buildings and other types of sustainability certifications for our buildings (ie Energy Star or BOMABest ratings) and currently 41 per cent of our real estate portfolio is certified to a sustainability standard  Fluctuating electricity prices are driving a strategic focus on energy efficiency in our real estate operations and as such, energy efficiency improvement projects are an important component of operational and capital planning We set annual energy conservation targets for the real estate portfolio and we strive to achieve these targets through usage monitoring, building systems optimization and capital improvements

" Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in ACEs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for ACE The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesn't anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by ACEs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for the ACE

"  The company is in a service industry, which is considered to be a relatively low contributor to emissions  The company recognizes it is important to consider the impact it has on the environment It encourages a culture in which all of its employees are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and be good stewards of natural resources  State Auto is committed to implementing efficiencies as opportunities are evaluated and potential environmental impacts are considered  Such efforts diminish the environmental footprint, which in turn has beneficial effects on pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, landfill burdens and fuel and water consumption  

State Auto works to purchase and use energy in an efficient, cost effective and responsible manner This affects the way we manage facilities, a fleet of vehicles and travel For example, the company has selected more fuel efficient vehicles We are replacing less fuel efficient vehicles with more efficient models while also maintaining and monitoring regular maintenance of our fleet, leading to a decrease in fuel consumption In 2018, our vehicles consumed 278,448 gallons of fuel compared to 256,337 gallons in 2019, a decrease in fuel consumption of 86% Since 2015, weve reduced our vehicle fleet size from 357 units to 285, a reduction of 20%, while growing our core business In 2019 the reduction continued as we reduced our fleet from 289 units down to 285, a decrease of 4 units or 14% We expect this trend to continue due continued efforts to manage the size of our fleet and improving operating efficiency from our vehicles     

In conjunction with the SMART Columbus initiative, State Auto introduced a ride share program in 2019 As many employees commute to business locations, State Auto promotes carpooling programs and encourages ridesharing, the use of public transportation and biking to work  We continued to support a CoGo Bike Share station on our corporate headquarters campus This provides easy access to associates for short trips in our downtown area  We encourage work from home options whenever possible to further reduce the need for commuting and additional office space At the time of writing this update, almost 90% of State Auto associates are working from home and have been since mid-March 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 State Auto is committed to serving customers locally, placing field associates near independent agency representatives and policyholders, reducing the need for planes, trains and longer automobile rides  To further limit travel, the company utilizes telephonic and web-based conferences, along with video conferencing systems in multiple employee locations 


State Auto is committed to a multi-year project to consolidate our central Ohio employees into one work location, our corporate headquarters We are renovating floors in our two home office campus buildings to allow for the movement of associates from outside Central Ohio locations into our corporate headquarters by the end of 2020 2019 accomplishments include a complete renovation of 3rd floor office space in our Broad Street building and the demolition of the Boone Street storage building that had been part of our home office complex The space occupied by the former Boone Street building was converted into additional parking 2020 plans include complete renovation of floors #1 & 2 of the Broad Street building, and the west side of the 3rd floor of the Pavilion building  

Floor renovations noted above include brighter, more efficient use of energy and space Sensors allow for lights to automatically turn off when work areas are not in use  New work stations allow for a more collaborative work environment and reduce the required square footage per associate New updated mechanicals will also be part of these renovations, leading to a decrease in energy consumption 

Our mission to improve use of space and energy goes beyond our corporate headquarters location We moved our Indianapolis, IN associates to a newer more energy efficient location during 2018 In 2019, we moved associates in our West Des Moine, IA office into brighter more energy efficient office spaces We plan to move our Nashville, TN associates into more energy efficient space by the end of 2020 We have four external offices where we will allow leases to expire in the first half of 2021 Associates currently assigned to these offices will then work from home As noted earlier, almost 90% of SA associates are currently working from home now due to COVID-19   

Since 2015, we have reduced our average space per employee from 501 sq ft per associate to 338 sq ft per associate at the end of 2019, a 48% reduction Renovations underway in 2020 and 2021 will continue to reduce the footprint of space needed per associate, leading to even more efficient use of space and energy consumed by State Auto   
      
One of the most environmentally friendly changes we have made involved our decision to become a more digital company All of our personal lines new business is now done on our digital platform The last states for business owners and commercial auto policies being introduced to the digital platform were introduced in 2019 In 2020 we will begin the rollout of our farm, workers compensation and commercial package policies on the digital platform  
These new products utilize electronic transmission of policy and billing information to our agents and policyholders, dramatically reducing the amount of paper being consumed and policy information delivered via the USPS

We strongly encourage recycling of paper, cardboard, plastic, glass and cans  Such recycling efforts have been in place for well over 10 years We support a composting program in our corporate headquarters to minimize the amount of material going to our local landfill Automatic fixtures and waterless urinals are used in a growing number of restrooms and green traps have also been installed in bathrooms  which help with water conservation   We maintain a strict preventative maintenance schedule for equipment, which also benefits the reduction of energy usage and emissions

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Committee monitors and qualifies all material risks to Chubb through an annual comprehensive review of global business disciplines Risks are also quantified for underwriting, credit and investments via capital modeling, and risk tolerance is established and monitored The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to the Chief Financial Officer and provides updates, including on climate change, to the Board of Directors

Chubb has Emerging Risk Committees around the world that report their findings to the CRO These committees identify and monitor new and emerging hazards, from both property and liability perspectives, including change in weather patterns and the resulting associated risk We identify and monitor new and emerging risks by collecting data from many sources, including industry organizations and reinsurance partners; monitoring litigation and litigation trends; and engaging in internal analysis

Risk Assessment:
Risks are assessed and prioritized by their potential impacts, including risk of underwriting loss, investment risk and risk of changing customer need

Risk of Underwriting loss:
To assess the potential impact of climate change to significantly change our loss patterns we use catastrophe modeling, as well as projecting revised non catastrophe weather related loss trends In addition, we use a risk concentration management tool to monitor/control accumulations of exposure  Steps taken to manage exposure to weather-related risk include:
	reviewing the catastrophe model projections; 
	reviewing reinsurance terms and limits; 
	limiting underwriting exposure in peak zones;  
	reviewing and modifying our underwriting appetite and/or pricing and 
	encouraging our customers to take loss mitigation steps

Chubb Loss Control Services and Home Appraisal services play a crucial role in customer mitigation of many types of risk, including those related to weather

The Home Appraisal Service helps customers determine the potential reconstruction cost for their home and provides them with advice on loss mitigation Appraisers can offer security and fire prevention advice and identify safety measures in a home We also provide our Personal Lines customers with several informational tools to help them manage, prevent, and mitigate effects of weather-related events on their property On our website, for example, we have created a section Catastrophe Assistance with tips for before, during and after a flood, hurricane or windstorm, tornado, dust storm or wildfire We also have participated in public education programs to help homeowners mitigate their wildfire risk, including providing recommendations to use fire-resistive construction materials in wildfire-prone areas Prior to major hurricanes and wildfires, we attempt to reach out to our personal lines customers individually  

For commercial customers, our global network of experienced Loss Control risk engineers with deep industry and technical knowledge can share best practices to help mitigate or avoid a costly loss Our Loss Control Services approach is custom crafted to address each customers specific risks, including from weather-related events

Reinsurance:
We analyze our exposure to certain perils in various geographies, and we purchase catastrophe reinsurance to support that exposure and manage volatility in our results We purchase limits from reinsurers based on their financial position and ratings, and in order to diversify our coverage, we have issued catastrophe bonds which gives us access to capital on a multi-year basis

Catastrophe reinsurance coverage, including limits, geographies and perils, is reviewed and purchased annually and is based on our review of our probable maximum loss from extreme weather events such as hurricane, wildfire, earthquake, flood, winter storm and convective storms

Investment Risk:
We review investment risk and consider correlated insurance exposures when making bond investment selections to ensure that we are not overly exposed to environmental occurrences in any one geographic territory from both operational business (underwriting) and investment perspectives Additionally, we consider the impact of climate change when assessing the financial risk parameters of certain sectors, such as utilities, as well as investment classes such as corporate bonds and municipal bonds  

Risk of Changing Customer Need:
The operational risk review can identify opportunities to address emerging customer needs We have anticipated increased consumer demand for particular products as a result of climate change 

For example, as governments and industries seek to mitigate climate change and preserve natural capital, opportunities arise from the market for low-carbon energy and green technology We have over 25 years of experience in the Renewable Energy sector and have assembled a Clean Tech team to bring together expertise, products and services that support businesses innovating in such areas as smart grid technologies and resource optimization

In response to the increasing severity and length of drought conditions in the Western US and the subsequent increase in the risk of wildfires, we offer Wildfire Defense Services to our insureds in states most prone to these events The service will initiate efforts to help prevent or mitigate property losses, which may include the installation of a temporary perimeter sprinkler system or the application of a thin barrier of Thermo-gel® to the home or landscaping, if the threat of wildfire becomes imminent

" With respect to company automobiles, as of August 1, 2015, approximately 95% of the fleet has been converted to the lighter and fuel efficient Nissan Altima, with a resulting reduction in fuel consumption of 23, 000 gallons per month  The Altima is equipped with Pure Drive Technology, which, according to the manufacturer, reduces the CO2 emissions of a gas-powered automobile to those equal to a hybrid vehicle  

The company is in the fourth year of executing several initiatives to reduce paper use and mail volume  All locations have recycling programs for paper as well as beverage containers  With the recent implementation of paperless technologies for its largest book of business in California, the Claims and Underwriting Departments have been increasing electronic recordkeeping and correspondence through the use of enterprise content management (ECM) and workflow systems with the goal of eliminating paper files and utilizing paperless operations, digital capture and workflow technologies  The company has accelerated its Digital Strategies to conduct business electronically wherever possible including the use of Electronic Signature technology with its agents and customers and for internal document approval, and has implemented electronic delivery of billing notices and other policy documents, at the option of the consumer and as permitted by law  In the technology operations area, the company has achieved 92% server and storage virtualization and reduced its data center energy consumption by 38% through the implementation of efficient cooling control system and hot-isle containment  Additionally, the company is its fifth year of a Managed Print initiative that has resulted in achieving 28% duplex printing and has reduced the number of printers and copiers by 75% through the deployment of Energy-Star multi-function printing and imaging devices

The five company-owned office buildings in California are scheduled to undergo LED lighting retrofits, including the addition of computerized lighting control systems  The mechanical equipment servicing these buildings is being enhanced to better protect the environment, while decreasing their per unit energy consumptions Upon completion of this project, the company will be operating five buildings that will have received the Energy Star rating  All buildings will also be using recycled paper wherever possible, and recycled paper towels exclusively

Aetna also has an Office of Business Continuity Management whose sole purpose is to maintain continuity of services throughout a natural or other form of disaster, including those caused, directly or indirectly, by climate change Aetna also maintains a Corporate Event Response Team (CERT), consisting of department heads (or their appointees) from across the Company, which convenes in response to various crisis events and to coordinate Aetna's response to those events Business Continuity Management advises and consults to the CERT during crisis events The CERT and Office of Business Continuity Management regularly perform drills and other exercises to ensure Aetna can respond with maximum effectiveness in the face of any kind of crisis We believe Aetna, through its CERT and BCO teams, is well positioned to respond to climate change related issues
iii How risks/opportunities are assessed at the asset level
Aetna operations and activities predominately occur within Aetna offices The main climate change impact at the offices at the asset level is real estate and procurement Aetna's Real Estate Services department considers environmental impacts when making office leasing and other facility decisions by assessing the exposure of Aetna's facilities, eg, business interruption due to severe weather events, and by incorporating criteria into the selection process, eg, determining if the location may be flooded Our business continuity assessments include the hazards posed by climate-related risks - including temperature changes, rising sea levels and severe weather conditions/natural disasters Aetna also considers such risks at all stages of our real estate life cycle - including selection, building design, and operation, eg, assessing a building's involvement with the US Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program
Aetna's Procurement department and information technology areas similarly consider environmental impacts and enhancing sustainability practices in its equipment leasing, purchasing activities, and equipment end of life decisions Suppliers are evaluated annually on an enterprise level using a five-element scorecard followed by a strategic business review of the supplier's operational performance and level of compliance and risk A key component of the scorecard is an online sustainability assessment Opportunities for further development of sustainable business practices are discussed with each supplier
iv The frequency of monitoring (weeks/months/years)
Aetna's Sustainability Council reviews existing and newly trending environmental issues during scheduled meetings and receives input from the advisory groups Potential risks and impacts which may impact the corporation would be forwarded to the Aetna Executive Committee, as warranted
v Criteria for determining materiality/priorities
As discussed previously, potential risks are prioritized based on magnitude and likelihood of impact
vi To whom are the results reported
Aetna's Sustainability Council reviews existing and newly trending environmental issues during scheduled meetings Potential risks and impacts which may impact the corporation would be forwarded to the Aetna Executive Committee, as warranted"	871	en	mild gibberish
"  To summarize, they are:  
	Risks driven by changes in regulation
	Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters
	Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by changes in regulation:

Lack of regulation resulting in potential increased operational costs:  Future governmental emission programs either at the Federal, State or local level could impact our business Through trade organizations and other information sources, Unum keeps abreast of pending regulations that could impact our operations If a new regulation is implemented that impacts Unum, measures will be put into place to minimize the impact

1	Uncertainty surrounding new regulation resulting in potential increased capital costs:  As global transition to a low-carbon economy escalates, Unum will be required to comply with CC regulations as they are presented Compliance with regulations requires man-power and capital expenditure that would not have been required in absence of the regulation Unum Group owns four physical sites in four states, SC, ME, TN, and MA We operate these facilities utilizing green building best practices We are positioned to adopt new regulations when and if enacted Unum has a government relations department that stays abreast of federal and state issues relating to all topics, including climate change, and has positioned Unum to respond as regulations are being formulated and adopted

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by physical climate parameters:
1	Change in mean (average) temperature resulting in potential increased operational costs:  This risk could cause an increased expense for utility consumption required for employee comfort in any of Unum's office buildings For example, in the Southeast, increases in temperatures caused by emissions will require additional cooling resulting in higher energy consumption to provide employee comfort while working Actions taken to address this potential risk include upgrade to our building systems to improve operational efficiency and lessen expenses

2	Other physical climate risk drivers which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  the CHA campus is subject to tornado and severe storm damage; and Portland and Worcester are subjected to winter weather Shifts in weather patterns has resulted in major weather events such as tornados and flooding that can result in major physical damage to infrastructure in any of our buildings For example, in 2011, our Chattanooga, TN campus narrowly escaped damage caused by one of the 27 tornadoes that touched down in the area The campus suffered minor damage from the storms but was not directly impacted

3	Uncertainty of physical risks which could potentially increase both capital and operational costs:  CC presents a plethora of weather-related risks as weather patterns become increasingly more severe and unpredictable These weather patterns present challenges as abnormal occurrences continue to materialize These uncertainties, including extremes in precipitation, droughts, increased snowfall and ice, rises in sea level, cyclones, etc are becoming more prevalent and require strategic planning, funding, and mitigation efforts

In our US operations, we have identified the following risks driven by other climate-related developments:
1	Reputation- which could potentially result in a reduced demand for our services:  Unum provides services to a large number of fortune 500 companies and receives inquiries from customers about our environmental programs and performance and also from State Commissioners Negative publicity may result in current and potential customers from conducting business with Unum

" A robust Enterprise Risk Management program identifies potential risks and develops controls to systematically assess the impact of these risks to its business

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above

In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 

These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification

Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures 

Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

The company introduced programs that focus more on creating a more sustainable future by reducing our need for car travel In 2020, we took team members off the road by launching photo-based auto claims estimating capabilities and virtual home inspections The photo-based auto claim estimating program, alone, reduced the miles driven by the company employees by more than 596,000 miles in 2020 

The company is in the 10th year of executing several initiatives to reduce paper and postage by implementing digital document delivery to agents and policy holders All locations have recycling programs for paper and batteries as well as beverage containers The company encourages team members to recycle by providing onsite recycling bins and offering recycling and paper shredding events to employees who would like to safely destroy and recycle personal files The company also gives team members the opportunity to recycle personal use batteries at no cost, which has safely removed more than 640 pounds of batteries from landfills in the last two years With the implementation of paperless technologies for its largest book of business in California, the Claims and Underwriting Departments have been increasing electronic recordkeeping and correspondence through the use of mobile enabled customer portal, enterprise content management (ECM), electronic signature and workflow systems which have significantly reduced paper file creation and mailing  The company utilizes e-Signature capabilities and paperless operations in all of its core operational areas 

Core insurance software systems utilize digital capture and workflow technologies  The company continues to accelerate its Digital Strategies to conduct business electronically wherever possible including the use of Electronic Signature technology with its agents and customers and for internal document approval, and the company supports electronic delivery of billing notices and other policy documents, at the option of the consumer and as permitted by law The company provides a discount to many customers who choose paperless delivery, where permitted by law In the technology operations area, the company has achieved 94% server virtualization Additionally, the company is in its tenth year of a Managed Print initiative that has resulted in achieving 30% duplex printing and has completed an upgrade of all printers and multi-function devices to the latest Energy Star compliant multi-function printer devices Additionally, the company has substantially eliminated the use of personal desktop printers and is reducing its document printing operations with eDelivery initiatives The company is also in the process of implementing a native mobile application with broad self service capabilities for its policy holders to further promote digital experience and self-service functionality

The companys effort in reducing paper in daily operations led to an 80% paper reduction by our legal team and a 95% paper reduction by our underwriting team

Three of the five company-owned office buildings in California have undergone LED lighting retrofits, including the addition of computerized lighting control systems  The fourth building is over a quarter complete with plans to complete it in the near future The mechanical equipment servicing these buildings is being enhanced to better protect
the environment, while decreasing their per unit energy consumptions  All buildings will also be using recycled paper wherever possible, and recycled paper towels exclusively The Company completed the Southern California Edison Charge Ready program for more than 100 electric vehicle charging stations at two owned building locations in Brea and Rancho Cucamonga, California Additionally, the company began creating green areas with living plant wall to improve air quality and transitioning to drought-tolerant plants

In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Company to quickly move most of the team members to a work from home environment By the end of March 2020, over 96% of the Companys team members were working from home This has had significant impact on reducing emissions related to commuting to and from work 

With the company reducing its environmental footprint through eDelivery (paper not printed), paper recycling, cardboard recycling, and reduced miles driven by the company fleet, the companys environmental impact was estimated to save 32,215 trees and 162 million gallons of water, and 50 million pounds of CO2 was not created

Three of the five company-owned office buildings in California have undergone LED lighting retrofits, including the addition of computerized lighting control systems The fourth building is over a quarter complete with plans to complete it in the near future The mechanical equipment servicing these buildings is being enhanced to better protect
the environment, while decreasing their per unit energy consumptions All buildings will also be using recycled paper wherever possible, and recycled paper towels exclusively The Company completed the Southern California Edison Charge Ready program for more than 100 electric vehicle charging stations at two owned building locations in Brea and Rancho Cucamonga, California Additionally, the company began creating ""green"" areas with living plant wall to improve air quality and transitioning to drought-tolerant plants
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Company to quickly move most of the team members to a work from home environment By the end of March 2020, over 96% of the Company's team members were working from home This has had significant impact on reducing emissions related to commuting to and from work
With the company reducing its environmental footprint through eDelivery (paper not printed), paper recycling, cardboard recycling, and reduced miles driven by the company fleet, the company's environmental impact was estimated to save 32,215 trees and 162 million gallons of water, and 50 million pounds of CO2 was not created"	1038	en	mild gibberish

Building Utilities (specifically electricity consumption) 

	Replaced a cooling tower in the building in 2009 with a new high efficiency variable speed unit which uses less electricity and water
	Added timers and programmable set back controllers to control HVAC systems which allow us to turn off cooling during non-business hours and during winter when cooling demands are less
	Utilize lower wattage high efficiency fluorescent lighting in all areas
	All PCs and network copiers/printers are set to auto-sleep mode
	As CRT monitors fail, they are replaced with Energy Star rated LCD monitors
	Employee awareness  encourage all employees to conserve energy both at work and at home
	Light fixtures in the building are on switches that are programmed to turn off if there is inactivity in the area
	Trees and landscaping around the perimeter of the buildings are designed to shade the building to reduce cooling loads
	Torchmark has replaced our physical IT server environment with a virtualized server environment This upgrade to IT systems is expected to reduce electricity usage

Recycling  

	We monitor print and are committed to reducing the amount of print generated in our operations through the use of electronic communications and reporting We also work to identify print that can be eliminated or reduced
	Paper correspondence received is imaged and filed electronically This allows us to recycle virtually all of the paper received or produced
	Recycling was a focus in the design and materials used in the new building For example, the terrazzo flooring in the new building is made from recycled porcelain plumbing fixtures and the carpeting was manufactured by InterfaceFLOR using 25% post consumer or bio based materials 
	Personal hygiene products used in the restroom facilities are manufactured from recycled or renewable resource paper products

Water Conservation  
	All of the fixtures in the McKinney Texas restroom facilities are low flow fixtures
	Landscaping has been designed using primarily low maintenance native plants to reduce water consumption Sprinkler systems are on timers

Nationwide faces several potential business risks associated with climate change including:

	Catastrophic losses not limited to coastal areas potentially becoming more frequent (as in hurricane-related losses in the Midwest);
	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly (such as agriculture), or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions) These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc)
As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

Risk Sharing and Diversification: Responsible risk sharing, largely from reinsurance, forms the foundation of Assurant's risk mitigation strategy Assurant considers reinsurers as strategic partners and credits transparency to our strong relationships with more than 40 global firms In addition, the diversified composition of Assurant's business portfolio helps to mitigate the impacts from risks associated with a single physical location or business line As we continue to grow our businesses into new regions and markets, we further spread our physical and business risks 
Catastrophe Modeling: Assurant purchases forward-looking catastrophe and storm models from several modeling agencies Our in-house meteorologist, hydrologist and catastrophe modelers also work with modeling agencies to help improve Assurants models Assurant employs a proprietary view of risk, which combines and adjusts results from several models to arrive at a comprehensive annual assessment of our climate-related risk, policy rates and reinsurance costs 
Climate Resilience of Assurant Facilities: We assess all Assurant facilities for exposure to severe climate-related events and recommends improved climate resiliency where appropriate For example, we fortified our Miami, Florida office with hurricane resistance glass that provides protection from hurricanes rated up to category 5 and full electrical generator capacity for use during a tropical cyclone and/or long-term power outage We also provide optional electrical generators to most large facilities, with additional generators for data protection in select locations We strategically relocated our data centers in the United States several years ago, so they are in regions less vulnerable to catastrophic events We also use technology platforms that allow for virtual workstyles and data transfer to other facilities in the case of a severe weather events
Energy, Emissions, Waste: By decreasing our energy and emissions throughout our value chain, Assurant can reduce our operating costs and enhance stakeholder relationships Maintaining efficient operations also reduces the financial and operational risks posed by governments transitioning to low carbon economies, like a carbon tax or stricter environmental regulation At Assurant, we aim to identify, monitor and report our relevant energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve our energy and emissions intensity At an operational level, we set a goal to reduce energy consumption at our internally managed facilities by a minimum of 2 percent annually for the past eight years To achieve this goal, we invest steadily in energy-efficient lighting and HVAC systems and share best practices from successful facilities with other facility managers on a regular basis
Additional Opportunities: As we strengthen our climate strategy, we continue expanding our understanding of consumer needs and global trends, including a more comprehensive look at global climate change impacts To maintain market leadership, we will continue to incorporate climate change risks and opportunities into our decision-making processes and maximize our operational efficiency

We have a process to identify and monitor emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation We evaluate potential correlations between various risk events and categories, and monitor emerging risks, regulatory and rating agency requirements, and industry developments The Risk Management Framework, corporate strategy, and business objectives are all aligned, and risk management protocols and programs are embedded within every business segment

"M Life Insurance Company offer insurance products in life, disability income, long term care, annuities, and retirement services The companies do not write any form of property casualty insurance and so the climate change impact is limited to loss of policyowners life, disability of policyowners, impact on physical locations of the company, and impact on investments
At Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, CM Life Insurance Company and subsidiaries and affiliates of each (collectively, MassMutual, or the company), efforts to address environmental sustainability are more than just good corporate citizenship These efforts also create opportunities to reduce operating costs which, ultimately, benefit the people who rely on MassMutual every day:  policy owners and customers
Throughout everyday business operations, the company works to reduce its environmental footprint by effectively managing facilities and the natural resources consumed  In 2018, MassMutuals headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts was awarded the Leadership in Engineering and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification from the US Green Building Council The building also previously achieved LEED Silver in recognition of the companys ongoing progress with its sustainability efforts In addition to this certification, MassMutual has five other initiatives to provide long-term benefits for its people, planet, communities and culture:
1) Solar technology - MassMutual has a 35 acre solar array containing 1,750 photovoltaic and thermal solar panels on the roof of its headquarters This technology provides 384,000 kilowatts (kWh) of electricity every year and supplies 50% of the hot water Over their 20-year lifetime, the panels will reduce carbon emissions by more than 5,500 metric tons Additionally, the company has similar technology at a Denver, Colorado facility Finally, MassMutual has started construction on a new building in Boston that is expected to be completed in 2021, with plans to have a LEED Platinum rated building that focuses on using a minimal amount of natural resources  
2) Lighting and Energy use  The companys comprehensive energy efficiency program ranges from high-efficiency lighting systems and ""daylight harvesting"" to updating some buildings to heat with cleaner burning fuel to powering lawn mowers with propane gas Cleaner burning fuel will reduce environmental emissions by 97% and the sulfur content will be reduced from 500 parts per million (ppm) to 15 ppm
The company utilizes high-efficiency lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in the headquarters building, saving 450,000 kWh annually 
The companys Springfield Data Center has state-of-the-art technology and energy-efficient components for future growth This technology produces a savings of approximately 2,800,000 kWh per year, and due to their expected 20-year life, an anticipated lifetime savings of approximately 56,000,000 kWh Additionally, an upgraded chiller at the Enfield, Connecticut campus results in annual savings of 32,000 kWh
3) Waste Reduction  MassMutual utilizes technologies to reduce paper and water use As an example, over 500 water efficient plumbing fixtures reduce water waste by over 5,000,000 gallons annually The company has eliminated Styrofoam and single-use plastic straws from all campuses, and has adopted a plan to remove 50% of plastic cups from its campuses
4) Recycling  In 2018, the company recycled 2276 tons of paper and cardboard, 55 tons of e-waste, 12 tons of universal waste (lamps and batteries) and 12 tons of toner cartridges Additionally, MassMutual purchases eco-friendly office furniture and carpets made from recyclable materials that promote good air quality As part of a parking lot project at the headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts, the company also installed a rain harvesting system that irrigates campus grounds reducing water usage as well as reduces storm water discharge from the campus 
5) Transportation  MassMutual provides over 64 free electric charging stations to employees and visitors with the infrastructure to handle 400, upgraded its facilities fleet to contain more electric cars, and utilizes bikes, scooters, Segways and trikes The company also provides support for carpooling and vanpooling, resulting in more than 250 employees using some form of ride sharing MassMutual Commuter Services has previously received the MassDOT Pinnacle Award for Excellence in Commuter Options
In 2018, MassMutual was recognized by the Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as one of the Worlds Most Ethical Companies for the fifth consecutive year MassMutual was one of only three honorees in the life insurance industry, underscoring the companys commitment to leading with integrity and prioritizing ethical business practices

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:  (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes  (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk    

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-7 years

Risk: ReputationCorporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following: (1) Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2020 emissions reduction targets; (2) In 2018, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fourth consecutive year; (3) We closely monitor and respond to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility; (4) We gather and report on performance data both internally and externally; and (5) We also engage stakeholders, employees and corporate employer clients to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program and focus groups, surveys and interviews conducted as part of a multi-faceted materiality exercise currently in process

We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher   However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk
"	3	"Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers
We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets
To manage progress against our 2020 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio - in addition to ENERGY STAR®️ ratings Cigna currently has 34 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR®️ program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations
From 2016-2018, we have invested approximately $375 million in completed projects to help make the buildings in our global real estate portfolio more energy efficient Please note that this investment figure largely represents HVAC system replacements that were undertaken as part of our comprehensive, multi-year renovation at corporate headquarters

The American Family Insurance group of companies has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function that provides risk reporting to the board of directors (BOD) at least 4 times a year  Annually, the BOD approves the enterprise risk policy that describes the risk appetite and tolerance levels set by senior leadership of the enterprise The policy provides guidance to ensure risk exposures will remain within acceptable boundaries  The guidance provided by the risk policy considers natural catastrophe risk  
To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has several processes in place to ensure that emerging and evolving risks with the potential to impact the Enterprise continue to be identified ERM has historically facilitated a formal risk interview process annually As part of this process, all areas of the organization participate in risk interviews, including operating company leadership, division leadership, senior leadership and Risk Committee members Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business  One ongoing risk is the impact of severe weather events  While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations  Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance
American Family Insurances investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio  Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr or 41 tonnes CO2/yr We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  To continue our efforts, in 2015 we have also converted our 24,960 sq ft facility in Cherry Hill, NJ to green electricity and will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Gallons of fuel and tons of CO2 emitted in 2015 were 72% lower than 2014  A 51% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this six year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed four electric charging stations  at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in     many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We have completed the second year of this program, which will reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within our office buildings from 3,269 to 1,522 machines (53% reduction) and replace the remaining 47% with more energy efficient equipment; projecting an energy cost savings of $195,098, 1,300,653 KWh and 895 tonnes of CO2 over a 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping  
 
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%"	0	"As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

"  Liberty Mutual has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes   The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk  Liberty Mutual rigorously manages of its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest exposure simulation models from AIR, Risk Management Solutions and Eqecat  As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe exposures  

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds  By using both the exposure simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities  This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions  Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, catastrophe bonds, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

For internal ERM purposes, when evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures (the largest component of natural catastrophe exposures), Liberty Mutual utilizes a warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog  This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average  This ensures that Liberty Mutual is taking a conservative view of natural catastrophe risk and exposed capital

Another vital component of the ERM program is the monitoring and management of emerging liability risks  Liberty Mutual has a dedicated complex and emerging risks unit responsible for monitoring emerging risks and handling emerging risk claims, including climate change related risk and claims

Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

The following are the (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Thus, any regulations addressing climate change will not directly impact our products and services Rather, changes in environmental laws and regulations, whether inside and/or outside the US, are likely to impact Aetna's cost of doing business indirectly in the form of higher utility costs Aetna leases the vast majority of its office locations and expects that any changes in governmental policy concerning climate change will likely impact power generation (ie, utility) companies, which can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial landlords and other property owners which, in turn, can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial tenants, such as Aetna, over time
The scarcity of wood and wood pulp products may impact Aetna in any new construction project it might in the future undertake and would also impact the cost of office supply products, such as printer paper Other raw materials may also become scarcer or more expensive in the future due to the energy cost associated with their manufacture (eg, plastic) Those in our value chain will be similarly impacted through higher energy costs associated with their operations Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers  Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:  
At our corporate headquarters in Connecticut and in a few additional locations, Aetna possesses a modest amount of fuel burning equipment in order to handle power generation and business continuity needs in an emergency power outage situation We purchase low sulfur fuel for this equipment and would expect that any laws or regulations regarding the use of, and emissions from, this fuel burning equipment would impact Aetna directly However, based on past experience we would expect the activation and use of this fuel burning equipment to be an infrequent occurrence To help manage risks associated with a potential scarcity of office materials, Aetna has in place comprehensive recycling programs We use environmentally friendly paper for the printing of marketing materials, an effort that in 2012 helped save 302 tons of paper, and we recycle paper, carcboard, glass and plastic bottles Aetna has recycled fluorescent light bulbs since 1994, long before it was required

(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna has been unable to forecast the impact increased climate change regulation would have on our cost vs that from normal supplier variation (again, indirect costs) As discussed elsewhere (see Section 11, Energy elsewhere in this response) Aetnas energy costs, which are a direct cost, are integrated into annual budgets Any increase in fuel costs would need to be accounted for by the affected using department(s)

The following are descriptions of (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) The potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, with an owned corporate headquarters in Connecticut and leased space throughout the US and internationally, we consider our company to be exposed to physical risks As a geographically diverse organization with workers located throughout the US and several overseas locations, Aetna is exposed to the physical risks of climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) Specifically, in light of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) While some of the IPCC's scientific work has been called into question by some, there is evidence to suggest at least more variability in the world's weather - a phenomenon that has been called ""global weirding""  In light of all of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location  Aetna, as well as many of its vendors, customers and suppliers in Aetna's value chain are located in geographically diverse locations that might be impacted by these risks  We 
consider our company as well as those in our value chain to be exposed to physical risks
Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster
(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location If Aetna and others in its value chain experience these kinds of events, then the cost of doing business is likely to increase for all Aetna has been unable to determine if these costs would increase substantially over what is currently spent
We do not expect our company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change to our business operations, revenue or expenditure for the following reasons:

Aetna has been unable to determine what other climate change related risks it would be exposed to, especially those generating a substantive change to business operations Aetna constantly monitors impact drivers to its business and has determined that those directly impacting its health care business need the most attention at the current time
Aetna has been monitoring climate change legislation and regulation over the past decades and has not been able to determine if political leadership has any better idea of what will happen than Aetna does It appears that any legislation that will occur, notwithstanding political posturing, will be slow in materializing If so, this allows Aetna time to adapt its existing business processes to account for any changes at that time

Operational Risks
AIG currently operates within the US and in over 80 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa The company has facilities and physical assets that could be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change The areas with the greatest potential for catastrophe losses likely are the major metropolitan centers along the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US, as well as the urbanized areas and coastlines of other countries in which AIG has property insurance exposures Within the US, hurricanes pose the greatest catastrophic weather-related risk for AIG  

Other Risks 
Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments may include: reputational risk associated with the publics perception of AIGs carbon performance; and changes to consumer behavior based on changed preferences for products and services At this time, AIG believes that these risks will not have a substantive impact on revenues, expenditures or business operations, but the company recognizes that they may shape future considerations and strategies

As a global financial services provider with a relatively small environmental footprint, AIG is not an energy intensive business, nor does AIG consume large amounts of natural resources for the operation of business AIG does not consider climate change related regulatory risks to be material at this time Nevertheless, current cap and trade schemes and carbon taxes do affect AIG operating expenses in some geographies For example, in the UK AIG complies with the Carbon Reduction Commitment

AIG will continue to monitor regulatory developments, such as fuel/energy limits, carbon taxes, cap and trade schemes, emission reporting obligations, and heightened energy efficiency standards, and will assess the potential impacts of these developments on AIGs business

AIG currently operates within the US and in over 80 countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa The company has facilities and physical assets that could be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change The areas with the greatest potential for catastrophe losses likely are the major metropolitan centers along the eastern and Gulf coasts of the US, as well as the urbanized areas and coastlines of other countries in which AIG has property insurance exposures Within the US, hurricanes pose the greatest catastrophic weather-related risk for AIG
Other Risks
Risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments may include: reputational risk associated with the public's perception of AIG's carbon performance; and changes to consumer behavior based on changed preferences for products and services At this time, AIG believes that these risks will not have a substantive impact on revenues, expenditures or business operations, but the company recognizes that they may shape future considerations and strategies
As a global financial services provider with a relatively small environmental footprint, AIG is not an energy intensive business, nor does AIG consume large amounts of natural resources for the operation of business AIG does not consider climate change related regulatory risks to be material at this time Nevertheless, current cap and trade schemes and carbon taxes do affect AIG operating expenses in some geographies For example, in the UK AIG complies with the Carbon Reduction Commitment
AIG will continue to monitor regulatory developments, such as fuel/energy limits, carbon taxes, cap and trade schemes, emission reporting obligations, and heightened energy efficiency standards, and will assess the potential impacts of these developments on AIG's business"	354	en	mild gibberish

"  We recognize that the company has an associated carbon footprint through daily business operations and the organization is working to assess, reduce and mitigate these emissions
 
The Standard assessed the organizations carbon emissions in 2009 for base year 2008, measuring emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 categories (direct on-site combustion of natural gas, direct energy purchasing, and indirect emissions from various sources) This initial assessment focused on areas within the companys control, including natural gas and electricity consumption for company-owned properties and leased properties at the corporate headquarters in Portland, Oregon The assessment also identified emissions that were associated with core business operations, including emissions from staff commuting, business travel, land-filled garbage from the corporate headquarters, embodied emissions from paper purchasing nationwide, as well reduced carbon emissions from renewable energy credits purchased annually 

In terms of emission reduction and mitigation, the organization conducts intentional initiatives to reduce our environmental  and carbon  impact while simultaneously reducing costs and improving operational efficiencies 

The corporate Green Team is integral in the success of these initiatives, and all employees are encouraged to offer ideas for innovation and conservation 

The Standard received the City of Portlands Sustainability at Work gold workplace certification in 2019 Sustainability at Work offers three levels of certification to recognize a businesss positive effect on the environment and our community Certified applicants are evaluated on more than 70 factors related to their environmentally friendly practices in the areas of recycling/reuse, employee engagement, transportation, energy, water, and community engagement Gold certificate recipients must meet a minimum of 45 practices to qualify

At company-owned facilities, measures are in place to reduce electrical, heating and cooling demands as a result of upgrades The Tanasbourne building, for example, was built to be 34 percent more efficient than a conventional building of the same size and type These upgrades also involved careful planning to reduce the amount of product waste through the day to day operations of the facilities, ultimately sending less waste to the landfill to create methane gas through decomposition The Standard has partnered with the Energy Trust of Oregon to complete assessments and efficiency retrofits resulting in significant reduced electricity consumption in both office space and data center operations 

Computer equipment and hardware for printing, scanning and copying is Energy Star certified to further reduce electrical demand, and computers have been set to enter the power-saving mode after a period of inactivity from the user Many enterprise-wide software and desktop applications include scan features, eliminating the need for the creation or storage of paper documents  All employees are encouraged to turn off computers, equipment and lights when not in use; this practice is enhanced with a PC power management software tool which reduces power use when machines are not in active use Linear lighting in our office buildings uses LED bulbs

The companys data center, housed in a building that meets several LEED standards, sources electricity that consists of 38% from renewable resources The data center also incorporates energy efficient features that make it significantly more energy efficient than traditionally built data centers, including the use of LED lighting, motion sensors and energy efficient cooling technology

Business and staff travel is a large component of The Standards carbon footprint For staff commuting, the organization has made significant strides to reduce the amount of single-occupancy vehicle trips Having the headquarters located in downtown Portland makes it convenient for employees to use alternate modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, walking or carpooling The Standard offers a strong incentive for employees to use these modes of transit Prior to the pandemic, nearly 60% of The Standards 2,100 Portland employees walked, biked, carpooled, participated in a carshare, rideshare or took public transit as their primary commute method; subsidies and reimbursement are offered to employees who use public transit or carpool to work; sheltered, secure bike parking is available The Standard operates three electric vehicle charging stations in a company-owned garage, participating in the federal EV Project Business travel, however, offers fewer alternatives, and certainly represents a large portion of annual carbon emissions 

In early 2020, all 3,000 employees of The Standard were provided access to Microsoft Teams, an integrated business communication platform to engage more efficient and effective collaboration without the necessity of travel As we transition to a post-pandemic workplace, we expect a significant percentage of our employees will continue to work remotely without the need for commuting, and we will continue to prioritize remote meeting technologies over business travel where possible 

The Standards supply chain also seeks opportunities to reduce emissions associated with both supply delivery and embodied emissions of materials The company uses copier/printer paper that contains at least 30% recycled content, centralized printers are available and paperless workflow alternatives are used whenever possible

Business and staff travel is a large component of The Standard's carbon footprint For staff commuting, the organization has made significant strides to reduce the amount of single-occupancy vehicle trips Having the headquarters located in downtown Portland makes it convenient for employees to use alternate modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, walking or carpooling The Standard offers a strong incentive for employees to use these modes of transit Prior to the pandemic, nearly 60% of The Standard's 2,100 Portland employees walked, biked, carpooled, participated in a carshare, rideshare or took public transit as their primary commute method; subsidies and reimbursement are offered to employees who use public transit or carpool to work; sheltered, secure bike parking is available The Standard operates three electric vehicle charging stations in a company-owned garage, participating in the federal EV Project Business travel, however, offers fewer alternatives, and certainly represents a large portion of annual carbon emissions
In early 2020, all 3,000 employees of The Standard were provided access to Microsoft Teams, an integrated business communication platform to engage more efficient and effective collaboration without the necessity of travel As we transition to a post-pandemic workplace, we expect a significant percentage of our employees will continue to work remotely without the need for commuting, and we will continue to prioritize remote meeting technologies over business travel where possible
The Standard's supply chain also seeks opportunities to reduce emissions associated with both supply delivery and embodied emissions of materials The company uses copier/printer paper that contains at least 30% recycled content, centralized printers are available and paperless workflow alternatives are used whenever possible
The Standard actively engages with the business community, civic leaders, nonprofit partners, and employees to work on strategic, innovative policies and initiatives that will enhance the community and the local economy, while acting as good stewards of the environment for current and future generations"	978	en	mild gibberish

Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and flooding This unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's natural catastrophe loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided by collaboration with leading scientific institutions, the latest scientific knowledge, and loss experiences the models are updated on a regular basis The company's risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured losses and include findings in our risk models and underwriting processes

Understanding natural catastrophe risks and the impact of climate change is critical to cost our business accurately and to structure sound risk transfer solutions The damage caused by floods, storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters can affect millions of lives and the economies of entire countries In 2017, the hurricanes in the Caribbean and the US, the typhoons in Australia and Asia, winter storms and flooding in Europe, wildfires in California and Europe, and two earthquakes in Mexico proved the point again Total economic losses from natural and man-made catastrophes were more than USD 337 billion for the full year - of these, approximately USD 144 billion were insured Insurance payouts helped many to restore their lives, but even more were left with nothing once they could return to what was their home This shows that there remains a large need to reduce the negative effects of natural disasters  let alone to assure the funds needed to rebuild affected communities after an event  In 2017, our clients in P&C Reinsurance paid us USD 23 billion of natural catastrophe premiums (for losses larger than USD 20 million), equivalent to approximately 14% of total premiums in this business segment

On the investment side, we screen our portfolio on a number of ESG criteria, including climate change, and specifically carbon emissions, regularly and with the support of an external vendor Furthermore, we measure our exposure to carbon emissions in listed equities and corporate bonds in a systematic manner In order to mitigate the risk of stranded assets, we have also adopted a policy to avoid investments in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to improve its carbon footprint From an original investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology for cooling its buildings, to upgrading building fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, replacing much of its florescent lighting with efficient LED lighting, and the installation of white roofs on many buildings to lower heating and cooling requirements, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption Most recently, The Hanover embarked on a multi-million dollar project to replace over 300 single pane windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its Headquarters (HQ) facility in Worcester, Massachusetts The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the past ten consecutive years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines In addition, for the past eight consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed on The Hanovers 800K square foot HQ campus and a total of nearly 60% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers 14M square foot office portfolio is offset by certified Renewable Energy Certificates   

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively divert close to 40% of the total waste stream at its HQ facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions At its HQ facility, The Hanover partnered with Mass-Rides, a ride-matching service sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which rewards employees for walking, biking, telecommuting, carpooling, vanpooling, taking transit, or working a compressed week With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our HQ facility With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work schedules which allow many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our congested roadways For these efforts, The Hanover continuously earns the ECO Leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation for delivering excellence in commuter options 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most important, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint We have also witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced a material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and will continuously challenge The Hanover to deliver even more going forward

The Companys Business Continuity Team tempers the risk to the Company and insures that continued support is provided to policyholders, claimants, and customers during a climatic event The Company also manages risk aggregations on the first-party side via a variety of generally accepted modeling software products (most prominently Risk RMS, catastrophe modeling) The Company specifically restricts exposure to an event threshold of approximately 1:500 year Further, the Companys net retention is approximately $5MM which is well below our Board of Directors stipulated threshold There will be no exposure to any one risk in an amount exceeding ten percent of its surplus to policyholders per NYIL Section 1115 Such risk management is achieved through a combination of top-line restraint and reinsurance

" An in-depth understanding of risks is the basis of Munich Res business and Climate Change is closely linked to our core business as it can have a financial impact on nearly all of our lines of business
There are different types of risk (ranging from business to physical and other risks) affecting our com-pany and business, which are monitored and evaluated by specialized departments Risks may be driven by changes in regulation, in physical climate parameters, and other climate-related develop-ments
As described above, Munich Re Group faces various climate change related risks explained in detail in the CDP 2013: One example of other regulatory drivers could include the introduction of limits for greenhouse gas emissions or duties to inform/report/disclose the amount of greenhouse gases pro-duced by a product/service, or regulation changing building codes to prevent damage by extreme weather events
This may lead to liability claims based on noncompliance with such regulation (eg duties to inform, disclose or report, greenwashing/greenbuilding claims) A fundamental change in regulation or court decisions could also lead to successful claims because of greenhouse gas emissions as such Even if claims are unsuccessful, they could give rise to substantial defense costs in the US, owing to the ab-sence of a loser-pays rule Regulation changing building codes to prevent damage from extreme weather conditions could increase costs involved in rebuilding damaged/destroyed buildings covered by liability or property lines of business Potential plaintiffs could be victims of natural catastrophes (eg hurricanes like Katrina) or of rising sea levels (eg inhabitants of small islands)
Following (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated of the above mentioned example (taken from CDP 2013 answer):
i)The potential financial risk Munich Re faces relates to clients/insurance products and not to Munich Re as a company, as Munich Re itself produces a small level of emissions compared to other indus-tries; hence direct regulatory risks are rather unlikely Especially property insurance regularly covers losses that can be associated with the impact of climate change (CC) (eg changing frequen-cy/intensity of weather-related natural catastrophes) Whether liability for greenhouse gas emissions as such could be covered by liability insurance seems doubtful (emissions are intentional, not acci-dental; therefore no occurrence, pollution exclusion, etc) Losses indirectly related to CC (eg liability of architects/engineers for causing damage by not sufficiently considering global warming and its con-sequences) are often covered under liability insurance (eg PI, D&O) Therefore insurance coverage is generally available
Financial implications are difficult to quantify at the moment Losses indirectly related to CC are not a separate category, so little precise data is available Risks connected with CC, especially defense costs, could be a criterion for consideration in certain liability lines of business, especially if such litiga-tion increases in frequency
Outlook
It is necessary to distinguish between
¿ Direct liability for CO2 emissions as such: unlikely, but higher defense costs for likely defendants if occurrence clause makes coverage for such claims possible
¿ Indirect liability (= liability related to CC): likely to increase in importance due to stricter regulation leading to stricter liability and standards of care and to greater public awareness due to intensive me-dia coverage and growing consensus about man-made global warming
Liability related to CC (indirect climate liability) is likely to increase constantly (claims based on non-compliance with regulations or professional duties, eg failure to warn or inform), on conspiracy to mislead consumers/the public/legislation/courts by greenwashing or greenbuilding, shareholder liti-gation (if financial loss of shareholders is, for example, caused by non-compliance with climate related regulation, not sufficiently considering climate-related business aspects or greenwashing)
ii) MR was one of the first insurers to identify CC risks as being relevant for the insurance industry For nearly four decades, Munich Re has been monitoring and analyzing these risks in cooperation with experts in all relevant areas of science worldwide (eg cooperation with relevant experts and academ-ic/other institutions, exchanges on CC-related topics, participation in international conferences on CC-related topics, contributions to relevant publications)
Internally, Munich Re adopts a multidisciplinary approach to CC litigation, using and combining the experience and expertise of our underwriters, actuaries, claims departments and legal/science coun-sels with all areas of environmental, toxic tort and construction defect claims Munich Re is constantly monitoring the developments in climate litigation, climate-relevant legislation and other trends in that area CC is also a regular topic within our internal Emerging Risk Process (steered by Integrated Risk Management; the Emerging Risks Core Team and Emerging Risks Think Tank) Internal workshops and other events for Munich Re underwriters, claims people and risk managers regularly help to en-sure that anyone dealing with CC-related business is well informed about ongoing developments in that area
To support Munich Res cedants, a variety of workshops and conferences for clients complement Mu-nich Res publications on these issues Published conference transcripts (eg 13th International Liabil-ity Forum in 2009) and regular reports on ongoing relevant developments at the Annual Liability Regimes Conference and other market events make this information available to a wider audience among our clients Besides this, several Munich Re experts are members of the Geneva Associations Climate Risk and Insurance working group, which monitors CC-connected risks and publishes regu-larly on these issues
Munich Re's activities in the CC context aim to raise awareness of CC-related risks within and outside the insurance industry, sharing our expertise and enabling insurers and insureds to react to these challenges appropriately, both in the short term (eg considering these aspects in policy wordings) and in the long term (eg developing new products, exploring alternative energies) Insuring the con-sequences of CC is and will remain part of our daily business in many ways The publication Liability for climate change, as well as regularly published articles in our magazine Topics, document our approach, underlining our commitment to monitor and respond to such developments
iii) Dealing with risks caused by CC-related regulation or litigation is a part of Munich Re's ongoing re-search activities, product development, and risk management; and will continue in the future

1)	Current & Emerging Regulation:  Risk of increased compliance cost with California AB 32 was evaluated in 2018 We have a significant presence in California and are therefore considering the implications of California AB 32 In particular, the 2020 reduction target for carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in California is relevant to us given that we operate our own fleet of vehicles We evaluate and monitor this risk from a business risk/impact perspective in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes  We also considered risks from emerging state-level climate-related regulations in the United States from a compliance and business risk/impact perspective Twenty three US states  all of which we operate in  have adopted specific greenhouse gas emissions targets Emerging state-level regulations to support the achievement of these targets may have implications for our facilities and vehicle fleets in each state Climate-related risks from emerging regulations are evaluated in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes
2)	Legal: Specific climate-related legal risks evaluated include looting, harm to employees, and shareholder concerns in the wake of climate-related extreme weather events These risks were evaluated and monitored from a business risk/impact perspective We mitigate these risks through our Enterprise Response and Resiliency (ERR) program, which encompasses our Business Continuity program There are legal risks associated with new compliance schemes which we are working to mitigate by ensuring compliance in advance and prior to those schemes taking effect An example would be the plastic bag ban in place in California which we addressed one (1) year ahead of the mandated time Climate-related legal risks are considered in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes

4)	Reputational: As a provider of prescription medications and retail health services, we understand that a major disruption in our business can have serious implications for patients who rely on us for prescriptions and other health care needs The potential for impact to reputational risk can occur both during blue sky days as well as a result of a larger weather event or other incident Our Enterprise Response and Resiliency (ERR) team utilizes a risk assessment tool to continually monitor social media and other open information sources to analyze and assess risk to the enterprise Reputational risk is always a consideration in planning and included in our risk assessments and are a constant factor in our day to day monitoring ERR works to evolve and update risk monitoring processes and procedures to protect our colleagues, patients and physical assets as well as continue to deliver important products and services across our enterprise Climate-related reputational risks are evaluated in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes

"	3	"1) Current & Emerging Regulation: Risk of increased compliance cost with California AB 32 was evaluated in 2018 We have a significant presence in California and are therefore considering the implications of California AB 32 In particular, the 2020 reduction target for carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in California is relevant to us given that we operate our own fleet of vehicles We evaluate and monitor this risk from a business risk/impact perspective in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes We also considered risks from emerging state-level climate-related regulations in the United States from a compliance and business risk/impact perspective Twenty three US states - all of which we operate in - have adopted specific greenhouse gas emissions targets Emerging state-level regulations to support the achievement of these targets may have implications for our facilities and vehicle fleets in each state Climate-related risks from emerging regulations are evaluated in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes
2) Legal: Specific climate-related legal risks evaluated include looting, harm to employees, and shareholder concerns in the wake of climate-related extreme weather events These risks were evaluated and monitored from a business risk/impact perspective We mitigate these risks through our Enterprise Response and Resiliency (ERR) program, which encompasses our Business Continuity program There are legal risks associated with new compliance schemes which we are working to mitigate by ensuring compliance in advance and prior to those schemes taking effect An example would be the plastic bag ban in place in California which we addressed one (1) year ahead of the mandated time Climate-related legal risks are considered in conjunction with our multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes

" In terms of regulatory risks, air pollution limits, emission reporting obligations, and uncertainty surrounding new regulation could all pose a risk to the company As regulations on air pollution limits evolve to include GHGs, such as the Title V Clean Air Act in the United States, there is an increased risk to Chubb if clients cannot comply with the new regulations For example, as reported in the Chubb sponsored paper, Global Environmental Regulation: Big Demands, Bigger Challenges, fines up to $32,000 per violation can be levied for failing to collect data or report GHG emissions New emissions reporting obligations; and different regional emission reporting requirements, present an indirect risk to Chubb These various regulations have resulted in companies that are focused on reducing emissions and/or generating emission credits under the mechanisms created by said regulations These emission reducing/credit producing projects encompass an enormous variety of technologies, some proven, some more experimental Many of these projects are located in the developing world, and the regulatory and financial framework underpinning these projects continues to undergo rapid development As a result, these projects present a unique risk profile with heightened technical, political and financial risk, which Chubb assumes through its insurance products  Chubb is also among the largest and most advanced global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risk, with Chubb Environmental Risk units in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Typical cover includes premises-based exposures, contractors and project pollution liability, professional liability, and an array of cover for environmental clean-up projects As part of the potential insureds evaluation process when seeking applicable environmental risk transfer products, Chubb considers emerging trends when finalizing contractual terms and conditions as well as pricing 

There are also indirect risks due to the fact that our company provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may become more frequent or severe due to climate change Specifically, related to precipitation extremes and droughts, the areas exposed are property and crop coverage, which collectively comprise a meaningful share of our net written premium annually The risk is that actual losses in a given year may exceed the underlying underwriting and actuarial assumptions used to price products, thereby eroding profitability and, in extreme circumstances, shareholder capital Also, radical changes in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, could jeopardize or potentially eliminate certain Chubb markets through physical damage, price escalation and/or regulatory activity In addition, changes in climatology or local weather patterns may generate unpredictable patterns in hurricanes/typhoons or severe localized events such as freezing, flooding, tornadoes or hail Such unpredictability could negate the use of actuarial techniques and undermine our ability to price and risk-manage price offerings As a global property and casualty insurer, Chubb is exposed to potential losses from various types of weather-related events In particular, natural catastrophe related losses are reported annually and as needed for extraordinary events or periods In 2017, Chubb recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $27 billion compared with $11 billion in 2016 on an as if basis 

In Chubbs own operations, offices in strategically important locations could be affected by physical risks For example, Chubbs offices in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania represent a concentration of regional operations in North America, with more than 6,000 employees and several of the companys senior executives Chubbs offices in Hamilton, Bermuda, are the headquarters for the companys Chubb Tempest Re and Chubb Bermuda subsidiaries, as well as several corporate executives The Singapore office serves as the headquarters for Chubbs 14-country Asia-Pacific region and houses several regional executives and a multi-country telemarketing operation Specifically, as precipitation patterns change and the severity and consistency of storms increases, there is an increased chance of flooding or snow accumulation that could affect Chubb employees by limiting their abilities to commute to the office or affect Chubb offices by causing power outages Chubb has developed a business continuity framework to respond to any incident, including those related to climate change, that may disrupt business operations, regardless of the size, scope or cause"	3	"In terms of regulatory risks, air pollution limits, emission reporting obligations, and uncertainty surrounding new regulation could all pose a risk to the company As regulations on air pollution limits evolve to include GHGs, such as the Title V Clean Air Act in the United States, there is an increased risk to Chubb if clients cannot comply with the new regulations For example, as reported in the Chubb sponsored paper, Global Environmental Regulation: Big Demands, Bigger Challenges, fines up to $32,000 per violation can be levied for failing to collect data or report GHG emissions New emissions reporting obligations; and different regional emission reporting requirements, present an indirect risk to Chubb These various regulations have resulted in companies that are focused on reducing emissions and/or generating emission credits under the mechanisms created by said regulations These emission reducing/credit producing projects encompass an enormous variety of technologies, some proven, some more experimental Many of these projects are located in the developing world, and the regulatory and financial framework underpinning these projects continues to undergo rapid development As a result, these projects present a unique risk profile with heightened technical, political and financial risk, which Chubb assumes through its insurance products Chubb is also among the largest and most advanced global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risk, with Chubb Environmental Risk units in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Typical cover includes premises-based exposures, contractors and project pollution liability, professional liability, and an array of cover for environmental clean-up projects As part of the potential insured's evaluation process when seeking applicable environmental risk transfer products, Chubb considers emerging trends when finalizing contractual terms and conditions as well as pricing

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees

MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year
Any enquiry or suggestion regarding MAPFREs environmental record can be addressed to the following e-mail address  medioambiente@mapfrecom


MAPFRE has adhered to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) that were presented at Rio+20 Sustainable Development summit, held in Río de Janeiro (Brazil)
This initiative seeks to bring into business management, as a risk and an opportunity, environmental issues such as climate change, damage to biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, water management and pollution; social aspects related to financial inclusion, human rights, health risks arising from development and population aging, and issues related to corporate governance, regulatory compliance, ethical management, conflicts of interest and transparency These are referred to as the ESG factors
The Principles for Sustainable Insurance represent the first global framework for the world's insurance industry that takes account of the economic impact of such aspects on the business MAPFRE is one of the world's 30 leading insurers that form part of this initiative, which together have a total of $5 billion of assets and 100% of the world's premium volume

Through our proprietary impact framework within our Core Impact Bond strategies, we invest in projects and entities that directly benefit the environment, in keeping with our investment themes of Renewable Energy and Climate Change and Natural Resources As of the end of 2019, Core Impact Bond strategies invested over $3 billion in green bonds - bonds whose proceeds are earmarked to support environmentally beneficial projects or activities We continue to serve as an expert resource for both issuers and investment banks across fixed income sectors in how to structure, execute and report on environmentally beneficial deals  TIAA Investments served on the initial Executive Committee of the Green Bond Principles, which is working on developing voluntary guidelines for green bond issuance and impact reporting
Engagement with Portfolio Companies 
TIAA upholds the view that, as an institutional investor, we have a responsibility to foster long-term value creation through active ownership activities including direct dialogue with investee firms and proxy voting in public equities holdings  Our Nuveen Responsible Investing team implements this long-term perspective, in part, by communicating our view on material ESG matters, including the physical and transition risks from climate change and other salient factors that are likely to affect the long-term performance of individual companies and/or the broader market We encourage corporate managers and boards to carefully assess, manage, mitigate and disclose their ESG risks and opportunities along with robust, time-bound, and measurable ESG performance targets Ultimately, improvements in portfolio companies ESG performance is in our clients best economic interests as these measures help protect shareholder value 
In accordance with the TIAA Policy Statement on Responsible Investing, we recommend that managers in portfolio companies assess material climate-related risks and resource efficiency in operations, production processes, and supply chain management and that they publicly disclose meaningful data relevant to both  We consistently encourage companies that that are exposed to material physical or transition risks related to climate change to disclose the results of forward-looking climate risk scenario analysis, such as a scenario in which global average temperature rise is limited to two degrees Celsius or less above pre-industrial levels  We find that companies that evaluate the potential impacts of future climate scenarios on their key drivers of business performance are not only better prepared for the negative aspects of climate change but also are better able to identify potential opportunities stemming from the low carbon transition
Company disclosures should convey to shareholders how climate change may impact the companys long term business outlook, strategic planning and capital allocation decisions  
We believe that a companys board of directors is responsible for ensuring management accountability, assessing operational strategies and overseeing risk mitigation frameworks As part of this responsibility, we believe the board should guide the development of a strategic, long-term approach to addressing climate-change-related risks and hold management accountable for its implementation As such, we convey to board directors our expectations that they should readily engage with their management teams in developing corporate strategies and performance expectations to address climate-change-related risk  We underscore our expectation by emphasizing that all companies should adopt and report on relevant, science-based climate change management performance targets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement  
When voting on shareholder proposals related to global climate change issues, TIAA will generally support reasonable shareholder resolutions seeking disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of climate change on a companys business activities and products, and strategies designed to reduce the companys long-term impact on global climate We supported 83% of climate change proposals in 2019

s closely with corporate clients to help them translating climate hazards into a risk, which means quantifying the physical and economic impacts of climate change on their assets and business operations and implementing appropriate risk metrics into decision-making process AXA XL Risk Consulting services models the unique vulnerability of assets to hazards, eg estimate the physical damage associated to a given flood water depth, and quantify a wide range of direct and indirect economic consequences, such as the property damage associated with the said flood, the risk of disruption of the upstream supply chain or downstream distribution, the risk of interruption of production Some recent examples of analyses performed by risk consulting to support AXA XL clients are: 
	natural hazards prioritization analysis, aimed to identify regions and sites  among a clients portfolio, or supply chain  potentially more affected by natural hazards, as of today and due to climate change in the next 30 years; 
	water stress risk assessment, ie the assessment of potential water shortage and related impacts on business continuity and communities, as of today and in the next 30 years 
In addition to risk assessment, risk engineering is also able to support clients in tailoring the best risk mitigation strategy, and identify which countermeasures should be taken to control losses, or accelerate the pace and scale of adaptation, for instance reducing the physical vulnerability of assets by retrofitting, identifying alternate suppliers, creating backup stocks, or transfer risks, etc

Within AXA XL we have taken steps to encourage policyholders to reduce the losses caused by climate change-influenced events Our property risk consultants evaluate policyholders property exposures and provide recommendations to reduce the potential for property losses from natural catastrophe events (including hurricane, storm surge, earthquake and flood events) 

We have also helped our customers manage the fire peril This includes advice to reduce carbon emissions from the fires smoke plume, managing firefighting water runoff, the need to remanufacture damaged building materials, inventory, and equipment, and the need to place damaged material that cannot be recycled in a landfill 

We have approximately 300 risk professionals across AXA XL This includes Account Consultants that help clients to understand their portfolio, manage their risk and prioritize risk improvement activities; as well as Property, Machinery Breakdown, Construction and Environmental Loss Prevention Consultants in the field globally, who visit our customers key locations to help identify and mitigate risk These risks include pre-emergency planning and preparation, as well as developing recommendations on how to further improve site protection Specific areas of focus in wind-prone areas include detailed wind inspections to help our customers ensure they have the necessary protection in place to withstand hurricane-force winds Another key activity our consultants focus on is categorizing the flood hazard for every location they visit For those locations in flood-prone areas, they conduct detailed Flood Loss Estimates as well as survey current protection in place and recommend enhancements AXA XL has invested in their state-of-the-art Global Risk Maps tool, that gives consultants access to multiple flood assessment sources of information AXA XL Risk Consulting also has an active partnership with the University of Naples Federico II for flood and earthquake research

We regularly advise our clients on how to ensure that well-meaning energy saving products do not adversely contribute to a fire or make the facility more vulnerable to natural catastrophe losses We advise them on how to quickly recover from losses that do occur, which includes pre-planned and engineered environmental remediation strategies In addition, AXA XL is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), which identifies and promotes effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss

Insurance products represent an important tool to mitigate the impacts that climate change-related events have on our clients business and on countries economies Yet the difference between economic and insured losses (the protection gap), particularly in developing markets that are disaster-prone, remains significant As an active member of organizations like InsuResilience and the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), AXA as well as AXA XL, dedicate significant efforts to help close the protection gap The IDF brings together private sector insurers, reinsurers and brokers, together with the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, with the aim to support the G20 InsuResilience objective of insuring 400m more people in emerging countries by 2020 against climate-related disasters and of improving their climate resilience AXA XL plays an active part in this  effort In addition, as Chairman of the IDF, AXA Chairman Denis Duverne regularly speaks at conferences and events dedicated to raising awareness of climate related risk in the industry and beyond

Several insurance products underwritten by AXA XL serve to encourage policyholders to become more sustainable For example, AXA XLs Environmental Liability team in France offers two biodiversity-related products: an Environmental Risks policy covering Environmental Impairment Liability and Guarantee, and a M&A Environmental policy that facilitate the rehabilitation of former polluted industrials sites and help limit artificialization of soil and biodiversity loss In 2020, AXA XL France partnered with the broker Marsh to better preserve biodiversity by encouraging clients to carry out Biodiversity impact assessments and integrate the results into their accident risk prevention and management plan Joint clients with Marsh, meeting the above criteria, are offered a 25% reduction of the deductible for Environmental Risks policies

AXA XLs North America Construction business has developed tailored Builders Risk insurance programs to address clients mass timber project risks Mass timber, which includes cross-laminated timber (CLT) is gaining popularity in North America Its also considered a more sustainable building material; according to the Wood Council, replacing steel with mass timber would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15% to 20% The process of manufacturing timber uses substantially less fossil fuel energy per unit volume than steel, concrete, or aluminum, meaning that timber has a lower carbon footprint

Within AXA XL we share internally generated thought leadership through our online magazine Fast, Fast Forward, which includes articles produced by our environmental subject matter experts In 2020 for example, the Risk Consulting team published an article about preparing industrial facilities for the effects of wildfires The full article is available here:  https://axaxlcom/fast-fast-forward/articles/preparing-industrial-facilities-for-the-far-reaching-effects-of-wildfires

" If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its customers For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes) We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $10,052 million operating costs in 2020 Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions team continuously evaluates short-term and long-term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices To curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers Leveraging assumptions from the US Climate Resilience Toolkit (July 2016), which provides a net energy cost increase from higher temperatures of 10-20%, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2030-2035 is $820,000-$1,640,000, which is less than 02% of Humanas $10,052 million operating costs in 2020

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center As part of these efforts, in collaboration with Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions, IT, and our facilities management vendor, we have achieved Energy Star certification for both of our data centers

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2020, an HVAC Economizer Project commenced at our Waterside building, which is planned to save approximately 3,025 MWh and 1,395 mtons CO2e for a total investment of $834,000 Funding came from the HUM Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our customers Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue that may be caused by climate-related events Our work at home program has been thoroughly tested during 2020 while staying steadfast in our commitment to the needs of our health plan customers and simplifying access to care, reducing financial barriers and addressing social determinants of health A dedicated tool to track events is used to manage our response and communications, providing us with a readily available resource to understand any lessons learned

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, and are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change
"	3	"If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its customers For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed
If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts
Climate change risks may also affect Humana's premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes) We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts
Risks driven by changes in regulation
The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humana's total $10,052 million operating costs in 2020 Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal
Humana's Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions team continuously evaluates short-term and long-term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices To curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts
Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters
Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations
Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers Leveraging assumptions from the US Climate Resilience Toolkit (July 2016), which provides a net energy cost increase from higher temperatures of 10-20%, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2030-2035 is $820,000-$1,640,000, which is less than 02% of Humana's $10,052 million operating costs in 2020
Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center As part of these efforts, in collaboration with Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions, IT, and our facilities management vendor, we have achieved Energy Star certification for both of our data centers

" SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions 
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Centrals home office continues to reduce its carbon foot print  In November of 2009 the home office began a program to reduce electricity and natural gas consumption  From 2009 to 2012 Central reduced electric usage by 183% and natural gas usage by 225%

Because of our efforts in this area Central was recognized by the US Environmental Protection Agency as an Energy Star Building for 2011  Buildings that earn this award use a minimum of 35% less energy and generate a minimum of 35% fewer greenhouse gas emissions that similar building across the country 

In April 1, 2012 Central Insurance Companies received recognition from its electric provider, American Electric Power, for completing an energy efficiency project and reducing energy usage at it home office location in Van Wert, Ohio   

Beginning in 2003 Central embarked upon many paperless initiatives internal to our business processes and external to our independent agency channel and policyholders

AGENCY PARTNERS
In 2004 we eliminated printing and mailing all paper policy documents previously sent to agents  Agents are able to view and save policy related documents from our agent portal  We are also able to download policy information directly into various computer systems our agents use  That same year we eliminated all paper manual for our agents and our employees  That information is accessed online through our agency portal  Agents are also able to submit new applications for clients for most of our lines of business online rather than mailing those applications to us

POLICYHOLDERS
In 2008 we introduced an updated version of our policyholder portal to our market allowing policyholders 24/7 access to their insurance information  They can retrieve 2 years of policy and billing information They can pay their bill online and they can report and track a claim  69% of all premiums paid to our company are done via some form of electronic payment (EFT, E-check, debit or credit card) We introduced ebill and epolicy in 2009 and 2010 allowing policyholders to turn off paper documents  In 2011 we introduced an I-phone app of our consumer portal and in 2012 we introduced a mobile app for the Android platform  Some states have recently published plans to allow a mobile id card as valid proof of insurance; proof our actions to support a mobile platform have value to the market place and environment  To date about 25% of our Personal lines and Commercial lines policyholders access the consumer portal to interact with their insurance needs

INTERNAL PROCESSES
All underwriting and claim files are created and stored electronically  Emails and fax are seamlessly attached to electronic files without printing paper  Major vendors are required to communicate with us electronically as well  We monitor postage, paper and printing costs quarterly by employee and business unit  Each operating unit has authority to develop and implement a workflow solution that reduces paper

Lastly, fuel efficiency in our corporate fleet offerings is one of several important factors when considering our fleet vehicles  The Company continues to downsize vehicles offered  We also have begun offering 4-cylinder vehicles where appropriate

" Allstate completes a comprehensive inventory of all Scope 1, 2 and select Scope 3 emissions annually and reports the verified findings through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) questionnaire

In 2010, Allstate set a goal to achieve a 20% absolute energy-use reduction within our owned portfolio (approximately 39% of all locations at the time) against our 2007 baseline by 2020 Thanks to efforts across the enterprise, we surpassed our 2020 goal to achieve a 20% energy-use reduction in 2014 

We continue to reduce consumption by consolidating office space, recapturing heat energy as a byproduct of Allstates data center operations and optimizing the use of energy efficient equipment and systems 

The trend toward consolidating our office space into fewer, larger locations continued in 2019, creating more efficient utilization of space across our owned and leased building portfolios We also committed to purchasing enough RECs to cover 100% of our electricity use at our corporate headquarters in Northbrook, Illinois This agreement was established in Q4 2018 and covered all of the 2019 reporting year

Allstate operates a fleet of about 3,000 sedans and SUVs to support the business travel requirements of the Claims, Distribution and Service Businesses teams A few years ago, we started to use more hybrid vehicles to improve our fuel economy and reduce CO2 output We incentivize employees to choose the hybrid sedan by lowering the associated personal use fee In 2019, we moved to only hybrid offerings in the US and Canada, and as of early 2020 have a fleet comprising about 50% hybrid

We also focused on moving to more digital work environments and using technology to decrease our total vehicle footprint and business miles driven Overall, we have decreased travel by 865 million miles from 2018 to 2019 We have also decreased our total vehicle count from about 3,001 vehicles in 2018 to 2,837 vehicles in 2019

State Farm is concerned about the prospect of global climate change, its potential impact on severe weather patterns, and how that potential impact may affect the business of insurance  State Farm works with organizations across the country  such as the Institute for Building and Home Safety (IBHS), , and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes (FLASH)  to help protect our policyholders from the human injuries, property destruction and financial impact that can result from natural disasters and State Farm is a member of the Build Strong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use and general awareness of mitigation issues

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 
The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

ACEs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, ACE has adopted a shorter-term view of event frequency that is higher than the long-term historical frequency Standard & Poors has rated ACEs ERM process Strong, placing it among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurance companies in S&Ps May 2015 ERM rating report

ACE identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of risks ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum (PML) calculation) Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world

" Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    

Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2017, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems  We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles  

To manage progress against our 2020 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings In 2017, Cigna had 23 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program (18 of the sites were certified in 2017)  

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 4-10 years

Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets    

Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail  Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster       

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:  (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes  (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk    

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-7 years

Risk: ReputationCorporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following: (1) Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2020 emissions reduction targets; (2) In 2017, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the third time; (3) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility; (4) We gather and report on performance data both internally and externally; and (5) We also engage stakeholders, employees and corporate employer clients to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program and focus groups, surveys and interviews conducted as part of a multi-faceted materiality exercise currently in process

We believe thatif Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher  However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $46,138,000,000 operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $46,138,000,000 operating budget

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In addition, we invested $546,000 in data center energy efficiency projects in 2014 that will reduce energy costs by over $99,000 annually

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change

As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFRE's environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFRE's activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the public's awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change

"  While ACIA does not provide any premium discounts for green or energy efficient vehicles or homes, the Florida packaged policy has an additional wind mitigation discount available which is tied to the insured propertys conformance with applicable building codes  ACIA does offer discounts for Fortified Homes if the dwelling is certified as Fortified for Safer Living by the Institute for Business and Home Safety

ACIA is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), an organization focused on reducing weather related losses through research, education and preventative measures
The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change 

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)  

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change: 

	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green 

	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events 

	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building 

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS 
In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 

To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  

Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio

" A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified  amount;  secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our supply chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases In 2016, total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) increased by 62% and were thus 39% higher than in 2013 The main reason was a significant rise in business travel, which outweighed further gains in our energy intensity A second factor was that we created jobs in countries where power consumption is relatively carbon intensive, eg in India
 
Swiss Re has implemented a number of projects that reduce our environmental footprint:

	First, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Program After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 We are committed to source 100% of our energy needs from renewable sources at all our locations This is challenging because in a number of countries, there is a lack of renewable energy supplies This is why we helped to establish the Climate Groups RE100 initiative in 2014 as a founding member The goal of this initiative is to unite 100 of the worlds largest companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power by 2020 To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially again in 2016 and included more than 96 of the worlds largest companies at the end of 2016 We have recently also started to build our own solar power facilities Our large office at Armonk in New York State is our US headquarters, with more than 700 employees At Climate Week NYC 2016, we announced our decision to build a solar power plant directly on our own premises to supply our office with renewable power

	Second, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating back office tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year As a matter of fact, our energy intensity was 185% lower at the end of 2016 than in 2013 Partly, we achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones

	Third, we continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally  Business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips, including increased use of videoconferencing services  Despite these measures, the amount of kilometers travelled per employee and the associated emissions have been rising in recent years  A key driver is our continued expansion in high growth markets, which has brought an increase in teams distributed across different locations In 2016, the total distance each of our employees travelled on average increased by 86%

	Fourth, we have taken a number of measures to reduce waste internally  We have reduced the average amount of paper used by our employees in recent years by increasing access to scanning services While it is difficult for us to influence water use and waste generation at locations where we rent office space, we ensure appliances meet high standards of water efficiency in the office buildings we own Where possible, we strive to have waste-free office locations  For example, the Overland Park, KS, office is engaged in a pilot program to go waste-free and has not sent materials to a landfill for more than a year
  
	Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Program is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we bought and retired Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs) for a total of 80,700 tons of CO2-eq (CO2 equivalent) in 2016 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions

	Sixth, Swiss Re incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in its entire investment portfolio By implementing ESG benchmarks, Swiss Re makes ESG consideration an integral part of its investment process Furthermore, we stopped investing in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation We divested from all related equity positions and the vast majority of our fixed income holdings Additionally, Swiss Re targets a green bond portfolio of USD 15bn, primarily relying on Green Bond Principles, and invest in renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates For further information on our ESG approach, please see the following website and publication http://wwwswissrecom/about_us/about_our_business/asset_management/Responsible_Investments__Shaping_the_future_of_investinghtml; http://mediaswissrecom/documents/ZRH-17-11623-P1_Responsible%20Investments_WEBPDF

* First, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Program After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 We are committed to source 100% of our energy needs from renewable sources at all our locations This is challenging because in a number of countries, there is a lack of renewable energy supplies This is why we helped to establish the Climate Group's RE100 initiative in 2014 as a founding member The goal of this initiative is to unite 100 of the world's largest companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power by 2020 To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially again in 2016 and included more than 96 of the world's largest companies at the end of 2016 We have recently also started to build our own solar power facilities Our large office at Armonk in New York State is our US headquarters, with more than 700 employees At Climate Week NYC 2016, we announced our decision to build a solar power plant directly on our own premises to supply our office with renewable power
* Second, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating back office tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year As a matter of fact, our energy intensity was 185% lower at the end of 2016 than in 2013 Partly, we achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones
* Third, we continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally Business travel easily constitutes Swiss Re's largest emissions source today We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips, including increased use of videoconferencing services Despite these measures, the amount of kilometers travelled per employee and the associated emissions have been rising in recent years A key driver is our continued expansion in high growth markets, which has brought an increase in teams distributed across different locations In 2016, the total distance each of our employees travelled on average increased by 86%
* Fourth, we have taken a number of measures to reduce waste internally We have reduced the average amount of paper used by our employees in recent years by increasing access to scanning services While it is difficult for us to influence water use and waste generation at locations where we rent office space, we ensure appliances meet high standards of water efficiency in the office buildings we own Where possible, we strive to have waste-free office locations For example, the Overland Park, KS, office is engaged in a pilot program to go waste-free and has not sent materials to a landfill for more than a year
* Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Program is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Program, we bought and retired Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs) for a total of 80,700 tons of CO2-eq (CO2 equivalent) in 2016 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions
* Sixth, Swiss Re incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria in its entire investment portfolio By implementing ESG benchmarks, Swiss Re makes ESG consideration an integral part of its investment process Furthermore, we stopped investing in companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation We divested from all related equity positions and the vast majority of our fixed income holdings Additionally, Swiss Re targets a green bond portfolio of USD 15bn, primarily relying on ""Green Bond Principles"", and invest in renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates For further information on our ESG approach, please see the following website and publication http://wwwswissrecom/about_us/about_our_business/asset_management/Responsible_Investments__Shaping_the_future_of_investinghtml; http://mediaswissrecom/documents/ZRH-17-11623-P1_Responsible%20Investments_WEBPDF"	1461	en	mild gibberish

	Standards and Governance: continuous improvement of the Group-wide environmental management system (based on ISO 14001) 
	Environmental Reporting (measuring impact): achieving further improvements in the quality of data reported, and ensuring alignment to evolving external reporting standards and best practice
	Strategy and Projects (mitigating impact): develop new opportunities to achieve efficiency gains across operational and business processes
	Communications, Change and Relationship Management: continue to expand environmental networks across the business and broaden the use of business social tools for more effective information sharing and awareness building to achieve impact


In 2008, Zurich set its first global environmental target to reduce carbon emissions per employee by 10 percent by 2013 as compared to a 2007 baseline Zurich exceeded the original carbon reduction target in 2012 Following, Zurich set new environmental targets including a 50 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 40 percent reduction in energy per employee, by 2020 compared to a 2007 baseline In 2016, Zurich exceeded these targets achieving a 53 percent reduction in carbon per employee and 43 percent reduction in energy per employee In 2017 Zurich committed to further long-term environmental targets to be achieved by 2025 against a 2015 baseline  Those targets include Zurich achieving and maintaining a 20% reduction in total carbon emissions per employee, broken down by facilities and business travel emissions, as well as a 20% reduction in energy per employee 

See June 29, 2017 news release: https://wwwzurichcom/en/media/news-releases/2017/2017-0629-01

Additionally, Zurich has been carbon neutral since 2014, investing in the Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, a REDD+ verified project

Zurich has achieved these substantial improvements in environmental performance through the following key programs:
	Purchasing renewable electricity wherever economically and operationally feasible
	Sustainable buildings  Addressing the full building life-cycle, Zurich considers sustainability starting at the selection of our buildings, through construction and office fit-out projects, and during day-to-day operations
	Efficient travel practices  only traveling when necessary and using video and teleconference wherever possible instead Zurich encourages the transition to a more sustainable car fleet

In 2014, Zurich started sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at its North America headquarters in Schaumburg, IL They continued with this commitment at the newly constructed LEED Platinum headquarters which opened in the fall of 2016 As of 2016, Zurich North America sourced 63 percent renewable electricity out of its total electricity demand  Globally, 45 percent of Zurichs electricity comes from renewable sources

In addition to purchasing renewable electricity, the new LEED Platinum headquarters boasts a number of best practice examples in sustainable building including: a curtain wall system designed to maximize natural light; a system to provide high-quality indoor air; access to public transportation and accommodations for electric and low-emitting vehicles; incorporation of multiple green roofs, totaling more than one acre; landscape including 637 trees and more than 13 acres of native savannah plantings; walking paths and water features; rainwater harvest and re-use; recycling and reduction of waste during construction process and efforts to utilize locally-sourced building materials

In addition, Zurich has also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Zurich continues to work on reducing its impact from paper and printing Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Zurich has implemented a Managed Document Service (MDS) optimization program, reducing the total number of multi-functional devices (MFDs) ), and replacing the remaining fleet with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also deliver significant operational cost savings We have completed the third and final year of this program, reducing the number of MDFs within our North America office buildings from 438 to 348 machines (20% reduction) Find more information about Zurichs Environmental Performance:

"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for law suits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors 

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty and life insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

" These models are continuously updated to incorporate the latest available scientific information related to severe weather peril and are regularly updated with the most current policy-level exposure data to enable Liberty Mutual to monitor changes in severe weather catastrophe exposure Use of these models is incorporated into the underwriting process and aids in the development of risk selection guidelines In addition, catastrophe modeling is an important factor in establishing pricing differentials for individual risks as well as setting program rate structures These measures enable Liberty Mutual to effectively manage its natural catastrophe exposure portfolio

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated Corporate Exposure Management unit within the Corporate ERM department which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Companys catastrophe risk exposure This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutuals ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios, and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes

This Corporate Exposure Management unit includes a Catastrophe Research and Development team which evaluates the catastrophe models for alignment with Liberty Mutuals view of risk In particular, the team considers a range of event frequency and severity assumptions beyond those embedded in standard models and builds bespoke models using Liberty Mutuals historical data, third party tools, publicly available scientific data, and input from expert consultants The R&D team also regularly participates in industry conferences to keep current with the latest scientific understanding of climate change
 
Severe natural catastrophes are incorporated into a stress testing regime, which Liberty Mutual performs regularly as a component of its ERM program Stress testing informs the Companys understanding of the financial impacts (earnings, capital, and liquidity) of various deterministic stress scenarios or combinations of scenarios In this way, the Company derives increased confidence that the current portfolio of exposures does not result in a capital or liquidity impact that exceeds established tolerances

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated Corporate Exposure Management unit within the Corporate ERM department which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Company's catastrophe risk exposure This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutual's ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios, and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes
This Corporate Exposure Management unit includes a Catastrophe Research and Development team which evaluates the catastrophe models for alignment with Liberty Mutual's view of risk In particular, the team considers a range of event frequency and severity assumptions beyond those embedded in standard models and builds bespoke models using Liberty Mutual's historical data, third party tools, publicly available scientific data, and input from expert consultants The R&D team also regularly participates in industry conferences to keep current with the latest scientific understanding of climate change
Severe natural catastrophes are incorporated into a stress testing regime, which Liberty Mutual performs regularly as a component of its ERM program Stress testing informs the Company's understanding of the financial impacts (earnings, capital, and liquidity) of various deterministic stress scenarios or combinations of scenarios In this way, the Company derives increased confidence that the current portfolio of exposures does not result in a capital or liquidity impact that exceeds established tolerances

Lincoln Life Assurance Company of Boston is a subsidiary of Lincoln National Corporation (LNC), and both companies utilize Lincoln Financial Group as their marketing name (Lincoln Financial or the Company)
A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, has been compiled annually since 2012 by Lincoln Financial Groups Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams responsible for operating and managing Lincolns facilities In 2015 Lincoln Financial Group set its first carbon emission reduction target to reduce its Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 20% per employee from a 2014 baseline by 2020 
Lincoln Financial Groups most significant sources of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are a result of its building operations From a building energy efficiency perspective, Lincoln Financial has a program dating back to 1972 to actively monitor and manage energy used in the facilities it owns and operates  The company has an ongoing commitment to evaluate and act on opportunities to improve energy efficiency in both the short and long term  For example, Lincoln Financial Group began a major renovation of its largest owned property, located on the three-building campus in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina This five-year project will completely transform 270,962 square feet of office space in the Elm Building Energy efficiency is a significant driving force behind the transformation the building will undergo over the next five years 
In 2019, we continued to make good on our commitment to care for the environment through company-wide goals as well as personal actions inside and outside the workplace
We are pleased to report that in 2019 we surpassed two of our electricity and greenhouse gas emission goals and are on schedule to achieve the third goal  Lincoln has reported its carbon reduction strategy and emissions to CDP since 2014 as we strive for environmental performance transparency
Goal: Reduce electricity use
We have committed to reducing the electricity we use in Greensboro, NC, and Omaha, NE  two of our largest locations Our original goal for the Greensboro campus was to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by 2020 compared to a 2014 baseline In 2018, we surpassed that goal, achieving a 1768% reduction As a result, we set a new goal to achieve a 35% reduction by 2020 We are pleased to report that as of 2019, we have reduced our electricity consumption in our Greensboro location by 2311% since 2014
In our Omaha location, our goal was to reduce consumption by 8% by 2022 based on a 2014 baseline We are pleased to report that in 2019 we surpassed this goal with a total reduction of 1090%
Goal: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Our goal was to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per employee from purchased electricity (Scope 2) by 20% by 2020 against a 2014 baseline Lincoln is delighted to report that we have exceeded our target earlier than expected As of 2019, we have reduced our overall intensity per employee by 2742%

In its role to evaluate risk to the enterprise, the BOD conducts sessions on risk topics, including on climate risk

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has a process in place to identify and assess all risks faced, including financial, operational, technology, regulatory/legal and strategic risks New and evolving risk identification is conducted in conjunction with strategic planning Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business One of the risks is the impact of severe weather events While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

American Familys investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

Furthermore, American Family Insurance is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

Sun Life has expanded the scope of its environmental reporting through a greenhouse gas (GHG) Framework which includes completed data collection and GHG emissions calculations for years 2007 through 2017 for its Real Estate Investment portfolio and leased properties in Canada, for years 2013 through 2017 for its United States (US) Real Estate Investment portfolio and for years 2014 through 2017 for its International Corporate Real Estate and Investments portfolio and corporate travel As we continue to collect consumption data and calculate emissions, we expect to develop a deeper understanding of our emissions sources and opportunities for reduction or mitigation 
Building on the significant progress made in 2016 to expand the scope of our environmental reporting, in 2017, Sun Life committed to short- and long-term global GHG reduction targets: reduce our GHG emissions intensity by 20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030 (relative to a 2014 baseline) 

Our total targeted global GHG emissions intensity decreased by 147% as of the end of 2017, compared to our 2014 baseline year While we have made strong progress, we anticipate that the level of effort, investment and commitment required to reach our 2020 and 2030 targets will increase over time We view these targets as ambitious, but achievable Our year-over-year decrease in targeted global GHG emissions intensity was 26%, keeping us on-track to exceed our 2020 target These reductions are the result of proactive energy and resource management in the investment portfolio, the implementation of tenant and employee engagement programs, and leveraging advanced data analytics to optimize building performance

Our target is composed of GHG emissions resulting from energy, water, and waste (where weight data exists), and normalized to remove the impact of changing weather, occupancy and exceptional loads, for Canada, United States and International Real Estate Investment properties where Sun Life has financial control, and global corporate real estate properties >40,000 ft² where Sun Life has financial control, and is measured on an intensity basis (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot) relative to a 2014 baseline  Year-over-year reductions are calculated annually and cumulatively reported against the 2014 baseline Reported reductions account for the purchase of renewable energy credits and carbon offsets (net, market-based reporting)

Sun Life continues to focus on opportunities to reduce energy consumption and, in turn, to reduce GHG emissions Between 2015 and 2017, we achieved a 5% reduction in energy use intensity across our combined global corporate real estate and Real Estate Investment portfolio Our energy use intensity is declining as we continue to implement energy-efficiency projects and innovative energy management programs, and build employee and tenant awareness of their roles in reducing energy consumption"	0	"S) The Company is wholly-owned by Sun Life Financial Inc (""SLF Inc"")

"com  Our agent-facing FIRST platform enables on-line quoting, policy issuance, endorsements, servicing, billing and remittance for all independent agents/business partners  
The second of our web-based platforms, launched in April 2013, enables policyholders to make payments and elect paperless delivery of their policy documents, ie; the policy booklet, declaration pages and endorsements (formerly called pDocs)  In the six years since this self-service platform was launched, usage has grown significantly  As of 12/31/18, approximately 139,000 policyholders have adopted self-service to make payments (up 17% from the 119,000 users reported in last years response) and approximately 21,000 of those have elected paperless delivery of their policy documents (up 27% from the 16,600 reported in last years response)  While the number of policyholders electing paperless delivery of documents continues to grow rapidly, the greater impact is that 95% of our independent agents/business partners, who generate virtually all our written premium, utilize a business version of paperless
A more recent development is our eDocs initiative in response to 24 states eliminating the requirement for generic policy statements to be mailed and instead allowing them to be posted on a public-facing website  The eDocs program was piloted in two states in January 2019 and then launched in all 24 states that currently allow it in March 2019  As a result of this initiative, the Company saves an average of 47,000 sheets of paper per week which amounts to over 530,000 sheets of paper since March 2019  The use of eDocs also reduces the throughput on our high-speed Xerox printers and Pitney-Bowes inserter thereby reducing energy use as well as the use of toner and other associated consumables 

In summary, the two self-service platforms and the eDocs initiative enable the Company to:
(a) reduce the environmental impact of the use of consumables,

- Sustainability & Political Risk Management coordinates Swiss Re's climate change
engagement including our program of climate risk research
- Emerging Risk Management coordinates the identification, assessment, and monitoring
of new or emerging risks, including climate-related risks For example they have
concluded an assessment of the company's potential exposure to losses arising from
climate litigation, with a focus on the United States, and Swiss Re continues to monitor
this issue on a quarterly basis Further climate related areas which have been assessed
are heat waves, drought and wildfires
- Swiss Res Catastrophe Perils unit includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and
flooding This unit is responsible for the design and maintenance of the company's
natural catastrophe loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks
as part of the underwriting process for our insurance and reinsurance activities Guided
by collaboration with leading scientific institutions, the latest scientific knowledge, and loss experiences the models are updated accordingly on a regular basis The company's
risk and premium calculations are based on the probabilistic hazard models, which are
based on historic events To ensure our models and pricing calculations remain
accurate going forward in a changing climate, we have to make sure that we identify
significant future trends in natural hazards, quantify their long term impact on insured
losses and include findings into our risk models and underwriting processes

The Sustainability & Political Risk Management and Catastrophe Perils units collaborate
closely on our ongoing program of research devoted to enhance our understanding of
climate related risk and to assess the economic impacts of climate change on our portfolio
of business When this research generates valuable quantitative data, it is integrated into the company's risk management processes

Swiss Re has also implemented an internal platform in its property & casualty business
units called ""SONAR"" This initiative is designed to systematically screen evolving risks and changes in the risk landscape SONAR is a structure for the exchange of observations
associated with risk among different countries, cultures, and offices throughout the Swiss
Re Group SONAR thus helps to improve understanding of Swiss Re's future exposure by
reducing the degree of uncertainty related to future risks, including climate change risks

Swiss Re has entered several strategic groups to exchange knowledge on risk issues
including climate For example, Swiss Re is a member of the Chief Risk Officers Forum
Emerging Risk Initiative, which strives to present the insurance industry's shared position on emerging risks, and the company is a partner of the Global Risk Network of the World Economic Forum, contributing to its Global Risks Report Swiss Re is also a founding member of ClimateWise, an insurance industry platform to assess climate change risk A former CEO of Swiss Re is Chairman of ClimateWise and the company also serves on the Management Board

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on
the impact of climate change on local economies The findings of ECA research are made
available on a country-by-country basis on our website, in addition to our print publications, and we continue to update this as new findings become available Swiss Re was closely involved in a new project incorporating the ECA approach working together with New York City See (chapter 2):

"  Up until 2019, the firms emission reduction/mitigation activities were focused on the Companys operational footprint  With the appointment of our CSO and the staffing of an eight-member team, we have enhanced our approach to addressing climate change by making it more strategic and expanding it to across the global enterprise to include our operations, finance and risk management teams as well as our underwriting and investment businesses  

Notable actions taken include: 
	Establishing a firm wide Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) operating committee with representation from across the enterprise
	Developing a global vision and objective for our ESG program and establishing principles to drive our ESG decision making 
	Publishing our first sustainability report that reports on our carbon emissions in our US operations 
	Evaluating long-term emission reduction targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions
	Launching several multi-stakeholder and/or business-level work streams to build customized strategies and reduction roadmaps while coordinating efforts to ensure alignment, measurement, and drive progress 
	Building an impact measurement and reporting system to guide our strategic decision making, monitor progress, and enhance the quality of our reporting of our ESG activities 
	Enhancing public disclosure by launching a dedicated web-presence to provide information regarding our sustainability and ESG activities to stakeholders Visit our sustainability page for more details 
The emission reduction roadmaps are based on a three-Rs strategy with preference being given to i) reducing our emissions through improved efficiency, followed by ii) investing in renewable technologies and businesses, and finally, if needed, iii) buying RECs (renewable energy credits) and Offsets 

Below we have provided illustrative examples of actions we have taken to reduce our emissions across our operations



Liberty Mutual focuses on meaningful energy reduction and sustainability activities that let the Company act responsibly for both the environment and its policyholders Below is an overview of Liberty Mutuals energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards

LEED Building Certification 
	Liberty Mutual has 6 LEED certified buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for five buildings
	To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms 
	As the Company builds new and retrofits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints 
	Liberty Mutual works in accordance to best practices established through USGBC related to water efficiency (eg low flow fixtures), materials and resources (USGBC approved products and sealants), energy (motion, LED lights), and indoor air quality Liberty Mutual also ensures that these areas also meet guidelines set by local municipalities and landlords 
	At the Companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in Dover, NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston, MA office parking lot 
	In 2019, Liberty Mutuals Plano, TX facility added HydroFlow electronic water conditioning to increase the Cooling Tower efficiency by conserving both water and energy
	In 2019 (and since 2014), the Boston facility made modifications to the temperature control sequence and schedule programing to various HVAC systems at both the 175 Berkeley Street / 30 St James Ave and 157 Berkeley Street buildings resulting in significant energy savings Year-over-year savings from 2018 to 2019 were as follows: 175 Berkeley / 30 St James reduced therms by 18% and kWh by 7% while 157 Berkeley Street reduced therms by 18% and kWh by 6%
	In 2019, the Company diverted over 251 tons of furniture from waste disposal and donated  $1,891,791 in furniture to local nonprofit organizations and schools 
	By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio 
	Liberty Mutual identifies opportunities to introduce its thoughtful design and consideration of the employee experience throughout all offices such as:
o	Access to Daylight: having fewer offices and conference rooms on the perimeter of facilities to allow employees to have access and work next to natural daylight
o	Circulation and Connectivity: active paths of travel that result in employee interaction; spaces designed for visual and physical connectivity to encourage interaction between employees; and central areas where employees can gather and eat healthy food options

Catering and Cafeteria 
	Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and Plano, TX facilities 
o	In 2019, the Boston facility diverted 159 tons of organic waste from landfill and donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
o	In 2019, the Plano facility diverted 44 tons of organic waste from landfill
o	In 2016, the Bring Your Own Cup Program was implemented nationally to reduce disposable cup usage and switched the disposable cups from foam to paper
o	Liberty Mutual implemented the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the Plano cafeteria; the Company continues to learn and where appropriate apply this policy to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations 
o	The Companys cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc

Paper, Printing, and Office Supplies
	The Companys Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2019 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,801 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 4,057,716 pounds of CO2 avoided, 47,021 trees saved, 76 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 14,010 cubic yards of landfill space conserved
	In 2019, through Print$mart, Liberty Mutuals printing conservation program, employees conserved 19 million gallons of water, saved 22,715 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,693 tons, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 946 tons
	Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 22% post-consumer content During 2019, these initiatives saved 65,000 gallons of water, 140 trees, and 12,000 pounds of CO2 Note: Liberty Mutuals partner vendor no longer calculates kWh saved

"	0	"Up until 2019, the firm's emission reduction/mitigation activities were focused on the Company's operational footprint With the appointment of our CSO and the staffing of an eight-member team, we have enhanced our approach to addressing climate change by making it more strategic and expanding it to across the global enterprise to include our operations, finance and risk management teams as well as our underwriting and investment businesses
Notable actions taken include:
* Establishing a firm wide Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"") operating committee with representation from across the enterprise
* Developing a global vision and objective for our ESG program and establishing principles to drive our ESG decision making
* Publishing our first sustainability report that reports on our carbon emissions in our US operations
* Evaluating long-term emission reduction targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions
* Launching several multi-stakeholder and/or business-level work streams to build customized strategies and reduction roadmaps while coordinating efforts to ensure alignment, measurement, and drive progress
* Building an impact measurement and reporting system to guide our strategic decision making, monitor progress, and enhance the quality of our reporting of our ESG activities
* Enhancing public disclosure by launching a dedicated web-presence to provide information regarding our sustainability and ESG activities to stakeholders Visit our sustainability page for more details
The emission reduction roadmaps are based on a 'three-Rs' strategy with preference being given to i) reducing our emissions through improved efficiency, followed by ii) investing in renewable technologies and businesses, and finally, if needed, iii) buying RECs (renewable energy credits) and Offsets
Below we have provided illustrative examples of actions we have taken to reduce our emissions across our operations
Liberty Mutual focuses on meaningful energy reduction and sustainability activities that let the Company act responsibly for both the environment and its policyholders Below is an overview of Liberty Mutual's energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards
LEED Building Certification
* Liberty Mutual has 6 LEED certified buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for five buildings
* To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms
* As the Company builds new and retrofits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints
* Liberty Mutual works in accordance to best practices established through USGBC related to water efficiency (eg low flow fixtures), materials and resources (USGBC approved products and sealants), energy (motion, LED lights), and indoor air quality Liberty Mutual also ensures that these areas also meet guidelines set by local municipalities and landlords
* At the Company's Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in Dover, NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston, MA office parking lot
* In 2019, Liberty Mutual's Plano, TX facility added HydroFlow electronic water conditioning to increase the Cooling Tower efficiency by conserving both water and energy
* In 2019 (and since 2014), the Boston facility made modifications to the temperature control sequence and schedule programing to various HVAC systems at both the 175 Berkeley Street / 30 St James Ave and 157 Berkeley Street buildings resulting in significant energy savings Year-over-year savings from 2018 to 2019 were as follows: 175 Berkeley / 30 St James reduced therms by 18% and kWh by 7% while 157 Berkeley Street reduced therms by 18% and kWh by 6%
* In 2019, the Company diverted over 251 tons of furniture from waste disposal and donated $1,891,791 in furniture to local nonprofit organizations and schools
* By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio
* Liberty Mutual identifies opportunities to introduce its thoughtful design and consideration of the employee experience throughout all offices such as:
o Access to Daylight: having fewer offices and conference rooms on the perimeter of facilities to allow employees to have access and work next to natural daylight
o Circulation and Connectivity: active paths of travel that result in employee interaction; spaces designed for visual and physical connectivity to encourage interaction between employees; and central areas where employees can gather and eat healthy food options
Catering and Cafeteria
* Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and Plano, TX facilities
o In 2019, the Boston facility diverted 159 tons of organic waste from landfill and donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
o In 2019, the Plano facility diverted 44 tons of organic waste from landfill
o In 2016, the ""Bring Your Own Cup Program"" was implemented nationally to reduce disposable cup usage and switched the disposable cups from foam to paper
o Liberty Mutual implemented the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the Plano cafeteria; the Company continues to learn and where appropriate apply this policy to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations
o The Company's cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc
Paper, Printing, and Office Supplies
* The Company's Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2019 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,801 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 4,057,716 pounds of CO2 avoided, 47,021 trees saved, 76 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 14,010 cubic yards of landfill space conserved
* In 2019, through Print$mart, Liberty Mutual's printing conservation program, employees conserved 19 million gallons of water, saved 22,715 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,693 tons, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 946 tons
* Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 22% post-consumer content During 2019, these initiatives saved 65,000 gallons of water, 140 trees, and 12,000 pounds of CO2 Note: Liberty Mutual's partner vendor no longer calculates kWh saved
Auto Program and Commuting
* 100% of Liberty Mutual's automotive fleet (field drivers) consists of either PZEV (partial zero emissions vehicle), LEV (low emissions vehicle), ULEV (ultra-low emissions vehicle), SULEV (super ultra-low emissions vehicle), or flex-fuel vehicles
* In 2019 the Company reduced its fleet by 33%, reduced miles driven by <1%, increased MPG by 1%, and decreased gallons consumed by 4% As of year-end 2019 we achieved a 3% reduction in CO2 emissions

" These models are continuously updated to incorporate the latest available scientific information related to severe weather perils, and are regularly updated with the most current policy-level exposure data to enable Liberty Mutual to monitor changes in severe weather catastrophe exposure Use of these models is incorporated into the underwriting process and aids in the development of risk selection guidelines In addition, catastrophe modeling is an important factor in establishing pricing differentials for individual risks as well as setting program rate structures These measures enable Liberty Mutual to effectively manage its natural catastrophe exposure portfolio

Liberty Mutual has a dedicated corporate Exposure Management unit which has the responsibility for estimating the potential financial impacts of the Companys catastrophe risk exposure This unit is a vital component of Liberty Mutuals ERM program and uses probabilistic catastrophe models as well as other means such as industry benchmarking, realistic disaster scenarios, and historical loss experience to estimate the potential impact of catastrophes

The Exposure Management unit includes a Catastrophe Research and Development team which evaluates the catastrophe models for alignment with the Liberty view of risk In particular, the team considers a range of event frequency and severity assumptions beyond those embedded in standard models and builds bespoke models using Libertys historical data, third party tools, publically available scientific data, and input from expert consultants The R&D team also regularly participates in industry conferences to keep current with the latest scientific understanding of climate change

As part of our continued efforts to be accountable for our environmental impact, including our contribution to and impacts on climate change, we are educating our employees on the importance of eco-efficiency and the role they can play to help Sun Life meet its goals, while also engaging them in local green initiatives,

Collaboration:
We participate in various external forums and collaborate with others to better understand todays environmental challenges and how best to address them Some of these include: United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, CDP Climate Change Program and Corporate Knights Council for Clean Capitalism

Supporting Carbon Disclosure:
SLF Inc is a signatory to CDP, endorsing its annual questionnaire CDP has gathered the largest global collection of self-reported climate change information CDPs system enables companies around the world to measure, disclose, manage and share climate change information, playing a critical role in driving emissions reductions 

SLF Inc is a member of Corporate Knights Council for Clean Capitalism (CCC) SLF Inc contributes its experience and expertise with green buildings and bonds through participation in working groups supporting these initiatives 

From the CCC website (cleancapitalismcom): 
The CCC is a group of forward-thinking companies who seek the integration of ""clean capitalism"" principles into broader economic and social policy Clean capitalism is an economic system whose prices fully incorporate social, economic and ecological benefits and costs, and whose actors know the impacts of their marketplace actions By advocating for policy changes, the CCC seeks to create an economic model in which what is good for business is good for the environment and society

According to the CCC, they examined the market gaps that led to sub-optimal allocation of capital and set out a menu of high-impact, feasible policy options including:

a Sharing the tools and communicating the imperative to incorporate natural capital into our national accounts and provincial statements of financial position as a first step toward total wealth accounting Canada is now the only G20 country to include its natural resource wealth on its formal balance sheet, updated quarterly at a sectoral level of detail(1)

b Closing critical information gaps and ensuring access to finance to catalyze profitable energy efficiency investment opportunities The CCCs work has resulted in policy in Ontario that will require 15,000 large buildings to disclose energy and water use by 2018 This policy has also been included in the Federal Governments Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change

c Supporting provinces to launch green bond programs Ontarios green bond program, initiated with CCC support, now totals CDN$205b Quebec joined this year with a CDN$500m issue Working closely with the Federal Department of Finance, the CCC was able to secure commitment by the federal government to undertake research to publish a Canadian green bonds framework consistent with international standards 

d The CCC worked with the Ontario Securities Commission to build support for better climate disclosure, resulting in a country-wide review by Canadian securities regulators of climate change disclosure The review is expected to improve climate disclosures of Canadian-listed companies in line with the Financial Stability Boards Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures recommendations

e The CCC worked with the UN Environment Inquiry to produce research for G7, which helped lead to a G7 communique calling for increased sustainable financing fundamental to the achievement of sustainability and climate goals

f The CCC worked with UN Environment Foundation and the 2017 Italian G7 Summit to author the context paper(2)  that led to launch of the Financial Centres for Sustainability(3) 

g The CCC worked with the Canadian government to launch the Expert Panel on Sustainable Finance (4) 

h The CCC worked with TFSA to formulate recommendations public policy and private sector recommendations to catalyse Canadas sustainable finance opportunity (forthcoming September 2018)  

As provided by the CCC, with SLF Incs support, the CCC has also advanced the following initiatives to influence public policy on climate change:

Nassau Asset Management Company (NAMCO), Nassau's investment management division, is currently working on a formal Investment ESG policy and strategy in preparation to become a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment While all factors that impact investment risk and return have always been considered, Nassau is beginning to more formally incorporate ESG analysis into its investment decision-making process When completed, the Investment ESG Policy will document more specific ESG considerations for each asset class (ie corporates, sovereigns, real estate, etc)"	348	en	mild gibberish
  Some examples of these strategies include:  the development of bulletins describing steps to take pre-event of an approaching storm (eg, steps to prepare their property for an oncoming hurricane); providing post-event suggestions as to how to better mitigate the losses incurred by similar perils in the future  saving money for both the insured and carrier; and, providing more cost-effective rates for properties with superior structure that would have a better chance of withstanding high force winds from a number of different perils	5	Some examples of these strategies include: the development of bulletins describing steps to take pre-event of an approaching storm (eg, steps to prepare their property for an oncoming hurricane); providing post-event suggestions as to how to better mitigate the losses incurred by similar perils in the future - saving money for both the insured and carrier; and, providing more cost-effective rates for properties with superior structure that would have a better chance of withstanding high force winds from a number of different perils	100	en	clean

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categoriesWith regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

Liberty Mutual is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

 As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green

 IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events In addition, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events

 Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCycler
o	Shift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star

At Assurant, we believe that with the right approach, we can provide insurance for consumers currently in homes susceptible to extreme weather while maintaining sound actuarial standards Through our lender-placed insurance products, which also serve to protect lenders, consumers are provided the opportunity to secure coverage when other options may not be available Assurant is prepared and committed for the long term to remaining in Florida, for example, as well as other catastrophe-prone areas we service We take a long-term approach that is responsible to consumers, investors and society 

While we provide coverage for homeowners who lose coverage because of climate risk, we do not underwrite private flood policies in repetitive loss zones, as we believe it is important to follow responsible building practices We also educate consumers and regulators about the benefits of adopting climate-resilient improvements when constructing or repairing homes To incentivize these behaviors, where possible we offer discounts for those who have fortified their homes to mitigate the impacts of floods, hurricanes or other severe weather Most of our international home policies offer discounts for customers who build with more resilient materials and install wind mitigation features 

As one of the largest carriers of flood protection in the United States, we offer our customers a full suite of flood protection, including through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is reinsured, and through voluntary flood protection products that we underwrite To responsibly manage this risk, we employ flood specialistssuch as meteorologists, hydrologists and catastrophe modelersand leverage decades of experience to understand the intricacies of flood risk These underwriting practices and research investments support our long-term commitment to consumers who may be impacted by floods 
We continue to innovate new products to better serve our flood customers in the United States For example, we introduced a flood coverage enhancement called FlexCash, after observing that many consumers struggle with unexpected expenses before a claim payout arrives FlexCash provides an immediate fixed payout up to $10,000 after a flood event is verified using photographs This payment can help ease cash flow constraints that arise while we process a claim More than 70 percent of our voluntary flood polices include FlexCash In 2018, we also began offering limited flood coverage for renters Through the Federal Emergency Management Agencys Community Ratings System, we can discount flood insurance rates if the customer lives in a community that is taking action to mitigate long-term risks 

We also offer index-based insurance in certain geographies susceptible to climate change to protect consumers who are indirectly affected by extreme weather events Index-based insurance provides coverage to businesses that are indirectly impacted by climate change, such as a business owner whose surrounding neighborhood is damaged due to a natural disaster 

To help determine the protection solutions that best support our customers, consumers and the communities in which we operate, we engage with policy makers, government agencies and insurance regulators We work with regulators and state insurance departments to advocate for fair legislation that benefits our clients and end-consumers needs Through this dialogue, we develop new or improved products aligned with public policy interests

"  This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane  In addition, Homesite posts informational articles on our website that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils  At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event

Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
   	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
   	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
   	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
   
A few states (incl Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

Lastly, in 2014, our parent American Family, partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support researchers over the next 25 years in making residential roofs last longer and leak less often ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen small roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters"	5	"This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane In addition, Homesite posts informational articles on our website that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event
Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of ""going green and building strong"" recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
* As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of ""going green""
* IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
* Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that ""green"" building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders--for example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of ""building strong""

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2018 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $945,800 We continued to upgrade lighting in 2019 that will save an additional $134,400 per year, for a total annual savings of $1,080,200 going forward In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We also partnered with a local electric company to participate in a Demand Response Program On high-energy use days, Humana curbs our electricity usage by turning off common areas and exterior lighting as well as adjusting back-of-the-house systems and asking associates to turn off any unnecessary power consumption  such as desk lamps Not only does this program reduce demand on the regional electrical grid, but it also raises awareness of sensible energy consumption among our associates  We also installed solar panels and reduced our carbon footprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

Humana also collaborates with internal and external partners to make joint decisions on data center projects to ensure the strategic use of funds that also provide sufficient returns in terms of energy efficiency We have worked with our equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and are implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of our data center equipment For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol In 2020, we undertook a more robust Scope 3 assessment to more fully evaluate our impacts along the value chain; this effort will also support our ongoing goal-setting work  The company provides transparency into our goals and progress by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

KPs web site details our efforts to be a leader in advocating health in all policies and all sectors, and in working to end health disparities We have been active in developing and promoting policies and projects that afford greater access to more active modes of transportation and that support local food production and sustainable sources of healthy food In 2010, KP helped to successfully defeat a proposed rollback of Californias strong climate change laws
KP has worked with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) to develop a water risk analysis framework for the supply chain of commodities (specialty chemicals, packaging, etc) that Lilly purchases for two of its major diabetes products for the US market UCSB used the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool to identify first-tier suppliers located in water-stressed areas and developed a system to evaluate commodities produced in areas of relatively high water risk The insight gained into water-related risk associated with suppliers can better inform future sourcing decisions by Lilly Lilly has used the information to assess if current supplier risk-management practices are adequate and to determine if additional data are needed to support sound risk-management decisions Lilly has also evaluated how they might apply a similar framework to other products
As described in our response to Question 3, KP has supported improved research and risk analysis on the impact of climate change

" We engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others

Much of the work Swiss Re does at the policy-maker level around the globe on the climate change topic aims to encourage a better understanding of the need for action as well as how the insurance industry can contribute from the perspective of a provider of risk transfer, a risk manager and as an investor Swiss Re generally works to support actions to help move the debate in the right direction rather than giving support for specific pieces of legislation For example, in Europe, we have continued to raise awareness of the important role insurers play in mitigating climate risk through different interactions with policy makers This includes speaking at industry conferences (Insurance Europe and the ABI), presenting at the European Commissions DG Climate Actions working group on Climate Adaptation and engaging bilaterally with the European Commission and national governments In the US, we have maintained regular dialogue with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), principally on climate change and natural catastrophes 

The RE100 group, of which Swiss Re is a founding member, approaches policy-makers and regulators at the national and sub-national level to make renewable energy more available, focusing eg on countries such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa over the next three years We helped establish Climate Groups RE100 initiative in 2014 to help make renewable energy more available The goal of this initiative is to unite the worlds most influential companies in a shared commitment to use 100% renewable power To achieve this, the group approaches policymakers and regulators at national and sub-national level to increase renewable energy availability RE100 grew substantially again in 2018 and now includes more than 190 of the worlds largest companies

Swiss Re leads a regular dialogue with national and sub-national policy-makers through a dedicated unit,  Public Sector Solutions Public Sector Solutions advises and develops business with governments and other public sector bodies and seeks opportunities in the microinsurance field 

In 2017 as an example, we helped develop the first parametric insurance solution for aquaculture in Taiwan, jointly with Taiwan Fire & Marine Insurance The programme will offer protection against extreme rainfall risk to 120 000 hectares of onshore fisheries in Ping Tung County, which together produce 25 million kilogrammes of grouper annually Grouper is one of the expensive fish breeds in Ping Tung County and represents a significant economic asset in Taiwans aquaculture industry As the 2009 typhoon season showed, however, fish ponds can suffer badly from extreme rainfall Flash floods due to typhoons caused many fish   ponds to overflow then, destroying nearly 50% of the fisheries in the process and causing large financial losses Using meteorological data, this innovative aquaculture insurance solution pays out automatically when there is rainfall of more than 480 mm for two consecutive days It is the second programme we have helped develop for the Taiwanese agricultural sector, in response to the governments initiative to transfer agricultural risks to re/insurers Allowing for quick payouts through its index-based trigger, the scheme helps to improve the sectors resilience It has attracted strong interest and demand from the fish farming community in Taiwan, and it is hoped that it will benefit further Asian countries in the future
Around the world, coral reefs harbor rich marine ecosystems and are vital for coastal protection However, they are under threat from a number of sources: disease, bleaching events, diminishing herbivores, algae overgrowth The most important short-term risk affecting reef structures comes from strong hurricanes: A category 4 to 5 hurricane can destroy 2060% of live coral cover In 2018, we supported the design of a new type of insurance product that offers protection against hurricane damage on the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System Stretching over 1 000 km, this is the second-longest reef system in the world and the longest in the Western hemisphere
Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks""  We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment  By the end of 2018, we had advised 96 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 82 billion in re/insurance protection

Climate change has the potential to significantly alter global weather patterns, possibly producing more frequent and/or more intense severe convective storms and hurricanes More intense storms may elevate the risk of both coastal and riverine flooding Wildfires could become more frequent and more difficult to control as drought patterns change Winter storms could drive cold weather conditions further south and into areas that are less prepared   For all of these potential weather changes, we utilize various commercially licensed software models and data to better understand the potential impact that adverse weather may have on policies we insure We also continue to monitor scientific progress to determine how climate change may impact CNA in ways not specifically accounted for by the models

" However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambias Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

 Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o Switch to more efficient servers
o Server virtualization
o Mainframe consolidation
o Increased data storage efficiencies
o Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o Upgraded our call center telephone system
o Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCyclerShift to print on demand and double-sided paper
 Real Estate and Facilities:
o Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels
o Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling
 Human Resources
o Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 27% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling
o Cambia also has a strong bike commuter program that encourages employees to bike to work The bike commuter program also provides support to beginning bike commuters through a bike buddy program and various bike-commuting workshops Cambia participates in May Bike to Work Month and the Bike Commute Challenge in September We estimate that 80 employees bike commute during the summer and 40 commute regularly by bike in the winter"	0	"However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambia's Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

"	A greener home office:
Horace Mann has virtualized approximately 700 servers in our Springfield data center, 200 systems in several IT Hosting Service Providers, for a total of approximately 900 systems including servers and workstations This has reduced our annual energy consumption by 59 million kWh and our CO2 emissions by an estimated 94 million pounds each year Estimates were calculated from statistics provided by the VMWare Green Calculator
Horace Mann utilizes an energy management system that allows proactive scheduling of lights and heating/ventilation/air conditioning allowing setbacks during non-core hours Light sensors have been installed in various areas allowing for lights out when not in use Our workstations are turned off on a schedule or when not in use, which provides not only energy efficiency; but also a cost savings to the company Our printers are set to use double-sided printing to cut our per-page paper consumption in half They also have a sleep schedule to reduce power consumption during non-office hours The majority of printers are black and white printers with less access to color printers, thus reserving color ink usage; the black and white copiers are the default setting for all machines 
As updates to the building and related grounds continue; energy-efficient ballasts are used in all ceiling lights where possible and LED lighting is used throughout the building Window and solar shades have been installed and maintained in various areas of the building to reduce the solar load and reduce cooling costs There are additional ongoing initiatives to curtail print output resulting in reduced electrical consumption and heat output Plans are also in place to replace legacy equipment with more energy efficient solutions

In 2018, Horace Mann entered into a contract with a new vendor to operate the companys onsite cafeteria and catering The new vendor has successfully eliminated the use of Styrofoam containers and plates in the home office They have replaced them with reusable plates and utensils that eliminate the amount of waste the company produces 

b	Home Office Recycling:
Recycling bins are located on all levels of the building in multiple, convenient areas of the office to remind employees to recycle first We encourage our employees to participate in recycling the following materials: paper, plastic, metal, cardboard, and printer cartridges 
The company also hosts an annual shred day for employees to bring materials in for shredding from home, which are then recycled
We recycle all computer equipment that is not functional, through a certified vendor All recycling or disposals of items beyond repair are conducted in accordance with environmental restrictions and have that adherence as part of the contract We donate functional equipment to a local, education servicing 501c3 entity
In conjunction with our corporate social responsibility efforts, Horace Mann currently partners in a vocational program with the Hope Institute in Springfield, Illinois as an employer of students The Hope Learning Academy, a division of the Hope Institutes, is a center that combines teaching, technology and a specially designed facility to allow students with varying developmental disabilities to achieve their maximum potential Part of their responsibilities within the program are the collection of recyclables; plastic bottles are collected and sent to the corporate recycling company and aluminum cans are delivered to the local recycling facility for processing The proceeds from the aluminum recycling program is given to the school to assist with school dances and other group events  

c	Educating  employees and customers
 Internal intranet articles are periodically published to remind employees to be conscious of energy consumption and to be diligent in turning off computer monitors and shelf lights when leaving for the night 
We encourage clients to register for online account access and claims reporting; eDelivery of premium notices and correspondence; and Easy Pay electronic payments on auto, property and life policies As we continue to modernize our infrastructure, we expect additional conversions from paper to electronic transmission Current estimates indicate that the company saves around 530,000 pages and nearly 189,000 envelopes by utilizing the eDelivery options

Posts to our Facebook and Twitter pages, emails and articles in our monthly e-newsletters encourage policyholders to participate in green observances and initiatives, such as Earth Day and school recycling programs 

d	Community Social Responsibility
At Horace Mann, we believe the environment is vital to the quality of life of our employees, agents, customers and communities As just one example of our commitment to the environment, our campus headquarters represents one of the largest green spaces in downtown Springfield, IL Our building was designed by world-renowned architect Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the original World Trade Center in New York City We maintain the award-winning grounds, outdoor seating, fountains and Remembrance Garden for the benefit of both our employees and community

As a major employer in Springfield, our commitment to quality of life extends beyond maintaining and enhancing our award-winning campus In 2016, we purchased a nearby empty building that was in poor repair from the Salvation Army, enabling the charity to renovate another downtown building into a new community center The old Salvation Army building was demolished and is now the site of a new landscaped and fenced employee parking lot This parking lot replaced an adjacent lot, which will now potentially be used as the site for a new public transportation hub
In addition to changes within the structure of the physical Horace Mann building and its campus, interior changes are also taking place to help decrease the need for additional buildings and facilities In late 2017, a home office re-brand and refresh project began to help curb the footprint of our employee base Within this project changes are being made to bring more desk-space to the home office and bring more employees into the building without requiring outside space 

As climate change may increase the prevalence and severity of weather events, Horace Manns website provides information on how to build an emergency preparedness kit as well as the steps to take before and after a disaster strikes It also provides information regarding how to prepare for specific types of potential catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, wind, and winter storms Links to related websites (American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Hurricane Center, and the National Safety Council) are also provided for the convenience of our website visitors

Engagement with customers:
In July 2019, the sale of GreenOak to Sun Life closed, and GreenOak merged with Bentall Kennedy, resulting in a combined real estate investment management company, BentallGreenOak BentallGreenOak is our real estate investment management arm within our asset management business, SLC Management The following refers to former Bentall Kennedy assets
As a service-based organization, buildings are a large component of our GHG emissions By engaging our property managers, tenants and residents we seek to lower the overall emissions of our buildings and drive cost savings for building owners and tenants Properties managed by BentallGreenOak participate in a formalized Sustainability Tenant Engagement Program Through this program, property managers, tenants and residents are equipped with actionable information that encourages them to reduce their environmental footprint and live a healthier lifestyle The core components of the program are: energy efficiency and carbon emissions, waste diversion, water conservation and healthy spaces Tenant engagement at BentallGreenOak means equipping tenants with the tools and resources such as posters, videos, and newsletters, to make better operational choices each day, providing a high level of customer service, and a safe, healthy, and productive environment
BentallGreenOak regularly conducts tenant surveys to assess the impact of our engagement The ongoing feedback provided by tenants is invaluable to their property managers, providing a foundation for our teams to build strategies for continuous improvement and to measure success over time Our 2019 (Canada) and 2018 (US) survey results showed an increase in overall satisfaction rates in our office and retail properties in Canada as well as our industrial and retail properties in the United States Dedicated property management teams are always available to respond to tenant concerns and listen to ideas BentallGreenOak develops and uses customized and proprietary tools such as green lease language and a Tenant Green Design Guide These tools are used to engage tenants directly in an effort to promote sustainable occupancy and build-out, thus enhancing overall asset operating performance and tenant well-being BentallGreenOak establishes joint tenant-management sustainability committees to pursue opportunities to reduce a building's environmental footprint at many of our buildings BentallGreenOak also tracks participation in our tenant engagement program through the annual Sustainability Benchmarking Survey that all eligible properties in the BentallGreenOak portfolio are required to complete
Engagement with investee companies:
At SLC, credit research analysts are responsible for keeping track of their ESG engagement activities (eg, discussions of the relevant ESG issues with management) on a quarterly basis ESG engagement reports will be stored on ESG SharePoint site Credit research analysts use PRI guidance on ESG engagement for fixed income investors in their engagement activities Private Fixed Income teams engage with management in the normal course of deal due diligence and monitoring? If due diligence or monitoring uncovers particular ESG Plus related issues, an engagement specific to that issue occurs Private Fixed Income is in the process of determining a meaningful measurement of this engagement activity

In responding, State Farm has utilized the definition of impact of climate change risk developed for the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook which is
the impact of climate change risk may be identified as any significant change in the measures of climate over an extended period of time that includes major changes in relative temperatures, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)
Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1983 - 2017, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 26%, with six of the largest ten non-hurricane catastrophe years occurring in the last ten years after adjusting for policy growth and inflation  This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the coastal regions, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change 
With respect to evaluating climate change risk, various units of the company(s) handle separate general functions, such as underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through the Enterprise Risk Management process   Within each function, there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels  Each function team is evaluating and determining how best to approach the evaluation, for example, multiple models are used to underwrite certain exposures, including those based on historical data and others on changing weather patterns  In these efforts to evaluate and model weather related effects State Farm is continuously investing in the latest tools and improving techniques to model severe weather in order to accurately measure risk to better match risk to price of the various products  
No - The company does not have a climate change policy with respect to investment management
Risks associated with State Farms investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farms financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders  While State Farm does not have a specific policy addressing climate change measures as they relate to potential risks to investments, investment analysis incorporates relevant risk factors into the decision making process, including impact on weather patterns and the innovation necessary to  produce reliable energy while lowering the carbon footprint  
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding  Restrictions on investments in unregulated energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry  Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are directly considered when evaluating investments in municipalities  In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification  We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy  Additionally, we provide financing to entities that support green efforts as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies

"  The Company is a member of the Board of Directors of the Geneva Association, which has an ongoing global initiative to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and develop strategies to enable the industry to address these impacts  

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

¿	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
¿	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
¿	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  



Engagement of policyholders is provided in several ways  The Company offers discounts to policyholders that have taken specific steps to reduce their susceptibility to extreme weather events through structural modifications to their properties  Policyholders are incentivized to reduce their CO2 emissions through products that cover structural modifications such as installed solar panels with full replacement guarantees, and discounts for hybrid vehicles  Other products and endorsements allow for replacement of existing mechanical equipment and appliances with upgraded high efficiency units in the event of a loss  The Company also has Loss Prevention units staffed by engineers and other technical experts who consult directly with commercial property owners and develop detailed plans for actions that can be taken to reduce the susceptibility of losses due to severe weather events

"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED ranking, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals are the most important components of the short-term strategy to address climate change  For this approach, short-term is defined as less than 3 years  Working toward these goals influences our operational practices by focusing our team on energy efficient facilities operations, and has begun to influence the way we interact with our supply chain It has spurred direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned and leased facilities These investments have enabled Humana to implement projects such as boiler upgrades, lighting control panel installations, the installation of VFDs, and other building upgrades to ensure that energy is being used as efficiently as possible at Humana's facilities  all steps toward our reduction targets In addition, our workspace optimization efforts increase the density of the workspace while also decreasing vacancy in buildings These efforts enabled us to reduce our physical footprint and alleviate commute burden, therefore reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities By the end of 2015, more than one third of Humanas employees worked from home and nearly 50,000 square feet of traditional space was converted to agile work space at eight locations

In addition, Humana has coordinated with our suppliers to better understand ways partnership opportunities can drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency These initiatives initially focused on Humanas efforts to reduce waste generation and waste taken to landfills throughout the companys supply chain We have since piloted our first ever Supplier Sustainability Self-Assessment Scorecard to assist our efforts to effectively manage risks, drive supplier improvement, realize efficiencies, and engage in responsible sourcing

Our long-term strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Workplace Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets Many of our facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years), whether these are leased or owned properties Humana has developed a sustainable real estate approach to ensure that investments in these facilities take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

" An in-depth understanding of risks is the basis of Munich Res business, and CC is closely linked to our core business as it can have a financial impact on nearly all of our lines of business There are different types of risk (ranging from regulatory to physical and others), which are monitored and evaluated by specialist departments, integrated into Munich Res Internal Control System While we are in a position to adequately assess the known risks in our portfolio on the basis of current climate research, scientific research into CC is complex and the political and regulatory environment in which we operate is developing fast: We must remain vigilant with regard to the identification/evaluation of new and changing risks If new findings in climate research or actual claims development necessitate adjustments in risk assessment, we are able to make these changes promptly because the contractual periods of most of our natural hazards covers are only one year However, changes in the physical environment and new regulations with re-gard to CC also open up many business opportunities  ie through new insurance products for re-newable energy technologies or coverage for extreme weather events
ii) CC represents one of the greatest risks of change for the insurance industry In the Corporate Cli-mate Centre within the GeoRisksResearch unit (GEO/CCC), we analyze and assess climatic effects and are developing a holistic strategic approach Findings are made available to all business areas and all business fields (reinsurance, primary insurance and asset-liability management) The main tool is our risk management discipline, which is firmly embedded in all our business operations We moni-tor and assess all identifiable risks holistically for both sides of the balance sheet
As our own operations and sites are primarily subject to physical risks (see iii), we incur most of our risks/risk types through business with our clients:
a) Risks customers transfer to us: We have specialist departments with expertise in risk manage-ment, underwriting and climate issues
b) Emerging risks: We track all kinds of risks constantly and have a competence centre that continu-ously monitors global issues, as new risk potentials and accumulation hazards are emerging, not only for economies but also relating to physical, regulatory, liability and health risks Together with Corporate Underwriting (CU), experts ensure that CC considerations are incorporated in our risk assessment/management, business/product development and asset management Research find-ings are passed on to CU and Integrated Risk Management (IRM) and used for product de-sign/pricing, accumulation control and adjustments to natural catastrophe models, and are also factored into our risk capital model calculations and risk strategy Risk information is collated by IRM and incorporated in control, management and operational processes at the relevant units Weprovide individual support in the quantification and management of CC risks A core component in the identification of risks is an IRM approach involving underwriters/client managers to ensure di-rect access to markets and dialogue with clients, ie an early-warning system that ensures that physical and regulatory risks are identified and assessed at an early stage, and Centers of Com-petence with experts who specialize in risk identification and analysis in specific lines such as lia-bility and geo risks research In all this, we use models based on assumptions and parameters that are continually checked for plausibility and comprehensibility, also by the Board of Management Common sense is indispensable in these considerations, as is the readiness to challenge the re-sults of calculations by means of stress tests and scenario analyses It is not possible, of course, to properly identify every risk or to always assess the correlations between different risks correctly But as recent years show, we have succeeded relatively well  also during the financial crisis  in taking sensible decisions on the basis of our risk management systems
iii) a) Risks arising out of investments in companies with high physical exposure to CC/exposure to changes in CO2 legislation; ie change in regulatory framework, not being prepared for emission trad-ing, energy-efficient production: this could result in higher operational costs/lower returns, and the same applies to cover for litigation risks We also integrate/translate our expertise in CC risks and op-portunities into new solutions for our asset management, eg a special sustainability fund We analyze not only risks, but also the business opportunities of companies in which we invest By the end of 2012, Munich Re has invested US $13bn in our RENT (Renewable Energy and New Technologies) program, rising to US $33bn in the coming years
b) We monitor risks for our sites and subsidiaries, ie meteorological risks of CC, such as storm, flooding or other extreme weather events that have a direct impact on us, ie on our buildings and on IT/other infrastructure As regards our ability to continue operations, each site and subsidiary maintain a detailed Business Continuity Plan; and specialized teams for exceptional circumstances are in place
iv) We constantly analyze known/emerging risks to determine whether there have been changes in their structure/occurrence probability, also focusing on identifying new risks at an early stage to offer solutions for risks up until now uninsurable Both risks and opportunities at all levels are constantly (daily) assessed by specialist departments and coordinated by GEO/CCC We also identify trends/faint signals in many ways, including systematic trend research and regular structured discus-sions in our Emerging Risks Think Tank (group of internal experts, meeting monthly) They derive conceivable scenarios and analyze their possible impact on Munich Re, also looking at interdepend-encies between different risks and other consequences related directly or indirectly to emerging risks Cooperation with external partners complements our internal early-warning system
v) As our business is insuring risks, the criteria for determining priorities/materiality are included in our business strategy approach such as loss probability and intensity: CC poses a serious risk of change to the insurance industry, so Munich Re started to investigate it from as early as 1973: a special re-search team was set up in 1974 to build up know-how in GeoRisks and CC Since 2007, a Group-wide CC Strategy covering all aspects  such as weather-related impact, regulatory impact and litigation risks  has supported our core Corporate Strategy The holistic approach embraces mitigation, adap-tation, research, in-house CO2 reduction and political advocacy as the main pillars to combat CC Mit-igation and adaptation in particular enable us to identify business opportunities/priorities

The companys risk management process identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on ACEs overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions 

Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

In its 10-K filed each year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ACE discloses risks that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition, and identifies the occurrence of natural disasters as a key business risk The disclosure further notes that climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business

ACE has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management and capital allocation purposes ACE uses these models to aggregate and monitor its natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return ACEs risk management modeling and underwriting practices continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change For example, due to the fact that Earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, ACE has adopted a more short-term view of event frequency that proprietary catastrophe modeling tools address as part of their underwriting process, and we strictly regulate the concentration of those risks we are willing to underwrite 

ACE also incorporates risk mitigation services through its risk management and site surveys; specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) ACEs modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation  and hence price differentiation  across our client base Clients that mitigate risk  through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains  will have lower insurance costs than those that do not ACE also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior 

The company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For ACE to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital 

We mitigate our exposure to climate change risk by actively hedging catastrophe risk in both the reinsurance and capital markets In 2013 and 2014, for example, ACE established two special purpose vehicles, Altair Re and Altair Re II, to provide additional capacity to broadly support its global property catastrophe reinsurance portfolio  ACE is committed to the development of the capital markets as an alternative or complementary mechanism to hedge risks Insurers can play a key role in the origination and underwriting of risk and its placement into the capital markets Such a partnership, in conjunction with the public sector, will help transfer and spread the risks posed by climate change We have demonstrated this commitment with the issuance of our own catastrophe bond, which provides fully collateralized protection against US earthquake and hurricane exposures 

In addition, our investment portfolio, which backs the risks assumed through our insurance business, is highly diversified by risk, industry, location and type and duration of security 

Successful risk transfer from policyholders to insurance and capital markets also requires industry standards around exposure data We are committed to helping the industry improve standards that will ultimately help increase risk transfer capacity and provide additional incentive for risk mitigation behavior by policyholders

" Additionally, increases in energy and fuel costs may result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers 

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets


To manage progress against our 2020 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings  Cigna currently has 34 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations

From 2016-2018, we have invested approximately $375 million in completed projects to help make the buildings in our global real estate portfolio more energy efficient Please note that this investment figure largely represents HVAC system replacements that were undertaken as part of our comprehensive, multi-year renovation at corporate headquarters



Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets    

Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail  Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster       

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:  (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol  (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication  (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes  (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk    

These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-7 years

Risk: ReputationCorporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following: (1) Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2020 emissions reduction targets; (2) In 2018, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fourth consecutive year; (3) We closely monitor and respond to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility; (4) We gather and report on performance data both internally and externally; and (5) We also engage stakeholders, employees and corporate employer clients to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program and focus groups, surveys and interviews conducted as part of a multi-faceted materiality exercise currently in process

We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher   However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk

KP carefully monitors studies and reports issued by government agencies and other organizations that speak to climate change-related risks, and uses these reports and findings to assess impact on KPs business
One way that KP may be able to regularly reassess climate change related risks over time is through health research carried out by the organization Two current research activities of note are:
1	Kaiser Permanentes Division of Research initiated a project, with funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, titled Climate Change and Health: Assessing the Risk of Preterm Delivery The aims of the project are to: 1) examine the association between temperature during the warm season and risk of PTD, and 2) assess the above relationships by maternal factors including maternal age race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status in women who delivered in Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals between 1995 and 2009
2	In 2005, Kaiser Permanente launched a program aimed at building one of the largest and most comprehensive resources in the United States for research on the influence of both inherited and environmental factors on peoples health The databank created through this program, now called the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank, has the ambitious goal of recruiting 500,000 Kaiser Permanente adult members to share health information and a small blood sample for research As of April 2017, the Research Bank is halfway toward its goal The Research Bank is already paying dividends in scientific studies that are examining the role of genes and environment in conditions as varied as diabetes, cancer, bipolar disorder, heart disease, asthma, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and migraine  among many others DNA samples are used to produce genotypic markers on the whole genomes of Research Bank participants, making it possible to study the role of genes in many different diseases and conditions As of April 2017, 100 research projects have been approved to use data from the Research Bank, and 32 studies have been published, including 3 in the prestigious journal Nature Genetics With 19 studies published in 2016, the pace is accelerating KP investigators and collaborating scientists can conduct research to understand genetic and environmental influences  including weather and climate influences  on disease susceptibility, the course of disease, and response to treatment; as well as to translate these findings into improvements in medical care and public health By studying data pulled from Kaiser Permanente Research Bank participants' health surveys, electronic health records and DNA samples, researchers are now looking for new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent certain diseases

Climate Change Impact on Market Demand
Changes in temperature and weather patterns across the US and the world have the ability to influence disease vectors and the spread of infectious diseases as well as the frequency and the severity of chronic illnesses  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, the 2014 National Climate Assessment shows that climate change is increasing health risk such as: respiratory stress from poor air quality, heat stress, the spread of food-borne, insect-born, and waterborne diseases  Extreme weather events impact vulnerable populations, often leading to fatalities

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

"  We expect the overall losses from the perils of Wildfire, Flood and Hurricane, which are sensitive to climate change, to increase for society as a whole, and the insurance industry in particular  Wildfire risk is of particular concern to us given our concentration in the western United States    In addition, multiple causation risks, including natural and man-made causes, make it more challenging to fully understanding and quantify our exposure to risk

Farmers uses both internal and external catastrophe models to make our best assessment of prospective catastrophe risk for pricing, capital optimization and reinsurance purposes  We adjust the models based on our own experience, research and historical model performance  Our modeling work generates outputs on a deterministic and probabilistic basis which we use to manage our enterprise view of risk  While the modeling data and outputs continue to improve over time, there is still uncertainty around the outputs  Farmers views this uncertainty as a reason to be cautious and conservative in our selection and pricing of risk, and our overall tolerance of catastrophe exposure

An increasing number of regulatory functions encourage us to view risk arising from climate change  However, other regulatory functions disallow the use of this view in our pricing or risk selection and require that we underwrite our business without consideration of climate change  Many states do not permit the use of near term hurricane models that account for current sea temperatures and other factors which are viewed to be related to climate change  Other states do not permit the use of wildfire models, although these states will attest that we are in a period of higher than average fire risk  Some states will not permit changes to the models based on our experience, which limits our ability to utilize our experience and expertise in our business  We believe the insurance industry would be better able to address climate change and provide leadership on this issue if each state worked towards a consistent standard regarding climate change  As the populace is being encouraged to prepare and live as if climate change is real, the insurance industry must be permitted to do the same  

While climate change presents uncertainty, our continued work on model validation and correlation provides us with humble confidence that we can reasonably estimate our expected catastrophe losses including significant amounts of volatility now and into the future We temper this with the concern that retroactive changes made to the laws and regulations governing specific catastrophes can make all of our planning, capital management and modeling useless We urge restraint in making any retroactive legislative or regulatory change after the catastrophe  This should be done only under the most serious of circumstances and only as a last resort

What we cannot account for or incorporate in our pricing or our own internal view of risk, is the exposure presented by regulatory uncertainty  Regulatory uncertainty includes actions such as directives issued by state insurance departments and governors limiting the application of hurricane and/or named storm deductibles to Superstorm Sandy claims, the reopening of earthquake claims numerous years after the Northridge Earthquake, the attempt to retroactively assess insurers for Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses five years after Hurricane Ike, and other post event changes made to commonly understood practices that were instrumental in our decision to insure these risks  These types of actions cannot be predicted, and thus cannot be incorporated into our models

UnitedHealth Groups environmental management team takes specific action to mitigate risk through participation in deregulated energy markets For example, the environmental management team analyzes the deregulated energy market in order to develop electricity and natural gas procurement strategies These strategies are implemented through energy supply contracts, which involve procuring energy outside of the regulated utility tariff In 2019, these energy supply contract opportunities resulted in an annual deregulated market savings and cost avoidance of $428,340 from purchasing energy at tariffs lower than the regulated utility tariff, which offset the increases in costs across regulated markets  

Inherent risks associated with increased severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters have a potential to impact our facilities and business operations With offices located throughout the US, we have operations in regions that are vulnerable to extreme weather events and natural disasters Over the past few years, both the frequency and intensity of natural disasters have increased In 2017, we saw the number of office closures due to severe weather more than double (compared to the prior 3 years), and we experienced significant financial impacts from extreme weather events (ie hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey) In 2018, operations were impacted by wildfires in Camp and Concow, California The Camp Fire was only 10 miles away from where our Chico, CA office is located Employees who experienced property damage resulting from the fire were permitted to leave work to take care of their personal needs Smoke particles from the Concow Fire entered our office in Rancho Cordova  Due to concerns about potential health issues due to poor air quality, charcoal filters were installed in the HVAC units In 2019, after ""red flag"" warning about the possibility of wildfires was declared in some areas of California, the electricity company PG&E began to shut down power to prevent wildfires igniting from trees that touch the electricity lines The past 3 years equated to over $2M in damages to our facilities  Note that the $2M is direct cost and does not include potential revenue and earnings impact (ie consequential) impacts)

UnitedHealth Group incorporates comprehensive energy and environmental management into its Enterprise Real Estate Services platform and collaborates with the Enterprise Resiliency and Response team which is responsible for monitoring and managing weather-related risks that have the potential to impact business operations  Using established processes and systems to avoid weather-related business interruption, we utilize a risk-based, comprehensive business continuity planning process, which includes risk scenario-based annual exercises and written contingency plans  Additionally, we have identified critical operational sites within our portfolio that are at highest risk of mission impact if taken out of service for an extended period, as well as most susceptible to utility outages and related impacts, and built in redundancies to handle weather related natural disasters  For example, we developed an investment strategy to deploy backup emergency systems as necessary at these operationally critical sites to mitigate the potential effects of extended power outages

Inherent risks associated with aging infrastructure to support the delivery of energy sources such as natural gas and electricity may have a potential impact on our business operations

UnitedHealth Groups headquarters and primary operations are in Minnesota The local utility, Xcel Energy, has seen increased costs to maintain aging transmission and power generation infrastructure In 2019, due to aging utility infrastructure in California, the utility company, PG&E, shut down power to prevent wildfires igniting from trees that touch the electricity lines As highlighted in the key findings of the Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: Our Nations aging and deteriorating infrastructure is further stressed by increases in heavy precipitation events, coastal flooding, heat, wildfires, and other extreme events, as well as changes to average precipitation and temperature Without adaptation, climate change will continue to degrade infrastructure performance over the rest of the century, with the potential for cascading impacts that threaten our economy, national security, essential services, and health and well-being Without attention, risks associated with aging utility infrastructure compounded by increases in severe weather and natural disasters may result in a greater risk of longer and more frequent power interruptions which could significantly impact UnitedHealth Groups core operations

 Changes in regulatory requirements (eg, emissions controls); 
 Changes in supply/demand for fuel (eg, oil, natural gas); 
 Developments in renewable energy sources; and

As a leading global insurance company and one of the world's top five asset managers, we are aware of the potential impact of our investment decisions We take seriously the responsibility that comes with the investment side of our business and are committed to systematically addressing controversial topics by integrating ESG considerations into our investment processes 
Sustainability in Proprietary Asset Management:
With proprietary assets of over 530 billion across a range of asset classes, sectors and countries, we are directly and indirectly connected with other businesses, sectors and economies, and are therefore an integral part of the globalized economy 
We strive to invest sustainably across all asset classes over time The practical implementation of sustainability in proprietary asset management involves integrating ESG factors into our investment process, for example through research, corporate and country analysis, asset manager selection, monitoring and risk management We firmly believe that considering ESG factors in investment management is not a short-term trend and over time will fundamentally change business, and consequently, investment performance 
Throughout 2013, we have developed an ESG Directive for Investments, which aims to integrate ESG as a standard practice into the management of Allianz insurance investment portfolios The Directive will be implemented in a step-by-step manner (2014-15) and intends to: 
Include ESG questions in the asset manager selection process
Assign asset managers to apply tailored ESG policies to the portfolios that they manage on behalf of Allianz
Include ESG-related topics during annual asset manager reviews 

Due to the range of asset classes we own around the world, the Directive does not provide a one- size fits all solution or standardized approach to ESG that all asset managers have to implement Instead, the responsibility for defining the best or most suitable ESG approach for a specific investment portfolio rests with the respective asset manager 
ESG factors are considered in investment processes for alternative investments, such as renewable energy, infrastructure investments, and real estate We are preparing the integration of ESG considerations into remaining asset classes in 2014 in line with our ESG Directive 
Furthermore, we continue to promote sustainable business practices within the companies we invest in Our approach is to seek dialogue to overcome challenges to sustainability For example we engaged with controversial sectors, such as extractive industries As a global investor we can have significant influence and we see it as our responsibility to promote sustainable business practices within the companies we invest in Our approach is to seek dialogue to overcome challenges to sustainability Throughout 2013, we have for example engaged with a major Asian energy company regarding environmental and HampS practices Furthermore, we successfully implemented an environment, social and governance (ESG) dialogue format, which continually engages a group of German and international NGOs The goal of this exchange is to establish an evidence-based dialogue built on trust and mutual understanding This allows our NGO partners to directly address Allianz with their concerns and gives Allianz the opportunity to listen and understand their different perspectives We can also tap into the expertise of NGO partners when formulating ESG positions and guidelines, incorporating their direct, on-the-ground experience of various topics Our ESG dialogue is part of our new ESG framework for the Allianz Group In this area, we plan to develop a formal ESG engagement framework to strengthen and standardize our approach to engagement with companies 
Acknowledging Boundaries:
As described above, engagement is particularly important for asset classes or investments where we cannot avoid indirect exposure to issues that could be considered controversial For example, due to our size we rely on broad indices with high liquidity as benchmarks for our large-scale investments While we need such instruments for diversification and hedging purposes, we have no influence on their composition Therefore we look to initiate and take part in dialogue with providers of such indices to determine how ESG issues can be integrated
Furthermore, as a large institutional investor, we aim to diversify our portfolio across many different sectors and companies Although some of these sectors are fundamental to economic progress, they are also prone to negative ESG impacts and may be controversial A typical example relates to fossil fuel generated power While there is the need to combat climate change, the rising global energy demand cannot be fulfilled without energy generated from fossil fuels For instance, renewable energy generation can be intermittent, so there is still a need for flexible back up from conventional energy sources when renewable energy supply cannot meet demand The use of fossil fuels will continue for the foreseeable future in order to meet rising global energy demand While we recognize the impacts of fossil fuels, we are not in a position to avoid such sectors as a general principle (as for example we do in the context of banned weapons, which our ESG process governs through a Group-wide exclusion applied to our proprietary investments, subject to limitations we are working to overcome when restricted companies are listed on major stock exchange indices, or where Allianz invests in investment funds managed by other organizations) As a result, and even though it might be perceived as a contradictory, we invest in both renewable and non-renewable sources of energy We see both sides of the argument  the need to contribute to global energy security and to economic development that relies on energy use, while also maintaining our commitment to contribute to a low-carbon economy
By the very nature of our business, insurance companies are also large- scale institutional investors and we take our responsibility as a provider of capital seriously Investment decisions are based on a systematic approach considering the potential risks and opportunities that could affect particular issuers and industries including considerations of climate change and other relevant ESG aspects material to the specific investment Going forward, we believe that an increasingly robust analysis of ESG-related issues is fundamental to understanding the long-term performance of investments We consider carbon being among the relevant environmental aspects for some investments, specifically for certain issuers and industries However, we do not consider carbon to be a steering metric for driving all investment decisions given the diversity of our investment portfolio, regulatory requirements and the fiduciary duty to our clients Additionally, the sole knowledge of carbon emissions would be a too narrow view - more importantly we need to understand the climate change context and adaptation strategies of issuers What is more, current levels of carbon emissions can lead to wrong conclusions as the competitive situation, regulatory environment, investments made and the long-term reduction path also need to be taken into account On top of this, there is no robust methodology and practicable approach, from an effort/ benefit perspective, available supporting the calculation of carbon footprint of investments Also, the availability and quality of carbon data is still insufficient Proposed approaches such as applying estimations and carbon footprint averages for whole industries reduce the meaningfulness of the information and, we do not deem it appropriate to base investment decisions on low quality data
Governance: 
At Allianz, all ESG related integration-activities (including with respect to climate change and investments) are centrally coordinated by the Group ESG Board, established in 2012 The ESG Board consists of three Allianz SE board members, responsible for the proprietary investments of Allianz, the asset management of Allianz as well as global corporate insurance lines The ESG Board determines yearly work-plans and holds ultimate accountability for integrating and strengthening ESG aspects within our insurance and investing activities 
The ESG Board meets quarterly and reports to the Group Finance and Risk Committee for decision-making Besides the designated ESG Board, several committees with Board member leadership play an important role in our decision-making processes: 
Group Finance and Risk Committee: controls adherence to the principles of the Group-wide capital- and liquidity planning as well as the investment strategy and prepares the risk strategy This includes establishing and controlling a Group-wide risk management and risk controlling system, also including sustainability risk The committee is also the decision- making body for ESG-related topics, based on analysis and deliberations within the ESG Board 
Group Investment Committee: oversees and reviews the investment activities of Allianz SE and Group companies in order to implement the Group Investment Strategy The committee also decides on concrete investment frameworks for covered investment assets 
In addition, several Board members assume direct responsibility for specific sustainability topics Functional departments also provide regular updates on sustainability issues directly to the Board 
With regard to responsible investment, the ESG Board: determines the overall ambition level for ESG integration into AZ proprietary investments; determines the specific ESG requirements towards Asset Managers, which will be incorporated in the RfP process and the Asset Manager selection process for new mandates; and receives regular updates on status of implementation and decides further implementation steps 
Board Members:
The Allianz SE Board Member responsible for Investments is responsible for ensuring that respective ESG Board decisions which regard responsible investment are carried out, and thus oversees the process of the ESG integration into Allianz' insurance investment portfolios 
AIlianz Investment Management (AIM) Leadership:
At Allianz, investment management is performed by a global function, Allianz Investment Management (AIM) It manages all assets covering the liabilities of all Allianz Group insurance companies AIM is responsible Asset-Liability Management, Investment Strategy and Asset Manager Management The latter includes the complete process of mandating internal/external Asset Managers for the management of Allianz assets
The CIO of Allianz Investment Management (AIM) obtains operative responsibility for carrying out ESG integration measures The CFO of Allianz Investment Management (AIM) obtains monitoring responsibility of the ESG integration into investments He further coordinates (1) the efforts of AIM Financial Control (AIM FC) in implementing concrete ESG requirements for the assets of Allianz insurance investment portfolios (proprietary assets); and (2) the efforts of AIM Asset Manager Management (AIM AMM) to consider the ESG approach and resources in the selection and regular reviews of Asset Managers 
Portfolio Managers/ external managers: 
Per the ESG Directive for Investments, all Asset Managers investing Allianz insurance investment portfolios are systematically assigned to develop and implement an ESG approach (process started in Q4 2013, to be completed throughout 2014-15) 

Due to the range of asset classes we own around the world, the Directive does not provide a one-size fits all solution or standardized approach to ESG that all asset managers have to implement Instead, the responsibility for defining the best or most suitable ESG approach for a specific investment portfolio rests with the respective asset manager 
Implementation is carried out by our mandated Asset Managers 
Carbon Investments:
Allianz is operating on a carbon neutral basis since 2012 In addition to continually reducing carbon emissions from our own operations, we offset remaining emissions through direct investments in carbon reduction initiatives, which generate CO2 certificates Investments to date include forest protection projects in Kenya and Indonesia (according to the UN, global deforestation is advancing alarmingly and currently accounts for around 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions) and an energy efficiency program in India, described below  Any remaining certificates after we offset our carbon footprint can be sold on the European carbon market to generate a financial return The carbon reduction projects we have invested in include:
Wildlife Works Carbon LLC (WWC): Through acquisition of a 10% share in this developer of REDD projects (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) we are supporting a forest protection project in Kenya WWC projects meet strict sustainability criteria and are the first of their kind to generate CO2 certificates By investing in WWC, we are highlighting REDD projects as an attractive investment option since they combine a high level of social and ecological responsibility with competitive returns for investors
Rimba Raya: In 2013, Allianz invested in the Rimba Raya (translated as eternal forest) project in Borneo (Indonesia), the world's first REDD project to bear the triple CCB Gold Label (Climate, Community amp Biodiversity Alliance) and the first that can generate certificates in line with the market-leading VCS (Voluntary Carbon Standard) With this investment, Allianz helps prevent deforestation of 64,000 hectares of forest avoiding the release of 90 million tons of CO2 
C-Quest Capital LLC (CQC): We are financing an energy-efficiency program implemented by CQC in India The program replaces incandescent light bulbs in private households with more energy-efficient and long-lasting compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) The program allows private households to purchase CFLs at a greatly discounted price, enabling them to lower their energy bills and improving energy efficiency in a country that frequently experiences energy shortages
Investments in Renewable Energy: 
Concerns about climate change are changing the way assets are managed and have given rise to new, alternative asset classes, especially in the field of renewable energy and carbon Allianz is an early investor in these new asset classes, and as a result we have already gained valuable experience and are benefiting from the opportunities they offer We see renewables as an investment opportunity with an attractive risk-return profile and are expanding our investments Investments in renewable energy projects are expected to provide sound returns in the long run (renewable energy investments with a maturity of 25+ years are typical), which fits well with Allianzs long-term investment strategy, which calls for manageable risks and attractive returns for durations of 20 years or more  For these reasons, Allianz is aiming for additional volume of around 400mn a year in direct investments in renewable energy projects
As large institutional investors, insurance companies are important players in financing a low-carbon economy Since 2005, we have made direct investments in renewable energy projects and the total invested by the end of 2013 was 17 billion, making Allianz one of the largest investors in this field Our renewable energy portfolio now includes over 42 wind and 7 solar parks in Germany, France, and Italy and Sweden with a total asset base of over 1000MW of generating capacity  including 250MW from wind projects acquired in 2013 Group centers of competence like Allianz Climate Solutions and Allianz Center for Technology provide a comprehensive view of the risks associated with renewable energy technologies to ensure that Allianzs clean energy investments are sound investments with stable returns At present, Allianzs renewable energy investments are realizing return of between 6 and 8%  much higher than many other asset classes  and uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the financial markets
Investments placed on behalf of Allianzs US insurance operating entities continue to play a role in the Groups renewable energy finance position In 2012, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America joined more than a dozen US insurance groups that invested $681 million in the Topaz Solar Farms as part of the California Organized Investment Network By producing a projected 550MW of electricity, Topaz will help the state comply with the California Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which requires that by December 31, 2020, each California investor-owned utility must procure at least 33 percent of its retail electricity sales from renewable energy sources 
In 2013, Allianz Life invested $80M in three additional renewable energy projects, including:
The Tenaska Imperial South (Csolar IV South) project - located in Californias Imperial Valley - and its nearly 2 million solar panels that can generate enough electricity (130 MW) to power approximately 44,000 homes The project began full commercial operation in early November 213 and has a 25-year power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGampE) 
The Solar Star projects, co-located in Kern and Los Angeles counties in California, that will deliver 579MW from more than 17 million solar modules, when complete 
Continental Wind, a 667 MW portfolio of 13 operational wind farms located across the USA
Real Estate:
Allianz manages a global real estate portfolio of currently around 30 billion, mainly in continental Europe Allianz Real Estate (ARE), a subsidiary of the Allianz Group and a leading international real estate investment and asset manager, continues to expand its worldwide-diversified real estate portfolio Allianz Real Estate of America, acting as a principal on behalf of the Allianz Group insurance companies, makes equity investments and provides commercial mortgages in the American markets  including a US commercial loan portfolio in excess of $6 billion on behalf of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America and Fireman's Fund  
Independently and as part of the Groups Risk Governance Structure as explained in response to question three (3) of this survey, ARE considers a variety of climate change related factors when assessing potential building investments, including for example the impact of natural catastrophes and climate impacts that contribute to high risk areas that may be excluded 
While adapting to physical impacts of climate change, real estate also needs to be part of the equation for climate and energy solutions  as buildings account for nearly 40% of both greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in the US, and globally An ARE pilot program in 2010 found that up to a 23 percent reduction in energy consumption and related carbon emissions could be achieved with relatively small investments Together with our tenants, we can work to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions
The ARE Sustainability Program:
ARE has a comprehensive sustainability program in place, with a focus on environmental factors, to support our Group commitment to significantly reduce carbon emissions and meet the demand for sustainable real estate 
The Allianz Real Estate sustainability program focuses on our core processes and creates a baseline and standards to assess our real estate's sustainability performance Environmental factors, such as energy consumption and carbon emissions, are the main focus area, which not only help our sustainability performance but also help to reduce operating cost for tenants, many of whom are Allianz entities 
The main activities of the Allianz Real Estate sustainability program are: 
Create Transparency 
Introduce common metrics for real estate sustainability
Assess and measure the sustainability status of ARE's real estate portfolio in a standardized way
Include sustainability in ARE's portfolio reporting 
Investment Management 
Include sustainability criteria in investment decision-making
Check the sustainability performance of new real estate investments as part of the acquisition process
Include energy efficiency and other sustainability topics in the due diligence process
Mandatory green building certification for new or refurbished assets (eg LEED, BREAM) 

Asset management 
Improve communication between ARE and tenants to improve sustainability performance
Include property-specific sustainability strategies into business plans Include energy efficiency into target setting with property and facility managers 
Assess individual properties' sustainability status using the Green Rating method (see below) 
Property management 
Measure, collect and report building information according to sustainability metrics 
Implement specific improvement measures in property planning Proactively suggest measures to further optimize buildings' sustainability performance 
Working with Policymakers amp Tenants:
Although the influence of sustainable properties has yet to fully materialize in the value of real estate, we see that regulatory requirements and changing market demand, especially on the tenant side, will force real estate owners to improve the environmental impact of their portfolios in the future  ARE actively engages with its tenants to further enhance the sustainability performance of its buildings  at the same time helping tenants to reduce their operating costs  ARE is taking the following measures to respond to changing customer behavior within our global real estate portfolio: upgrading properties (retrofit and refurbishment), adjusting portfolio strategy, and engaging with policy makers on related code and other mandates and incentives In general, tenants are developing a growing demand for sustainable space and energy efficient space  and ARE estimates that up to 5% of its current annual asset volume is required to comply with local regulations and to attract and meet the requirements of tenants demanding sustainable and energy-efficient properties
Standards amp Ratings: 
ARE is a founding member of the Green Rating Alliance (GRA), a European association of real estate owners and investors, auditors, industry bodies, measurement organizations and technology providers GRA has developed the Green Rating system, which provides a consistent approach to assessing, benchmarking and improving the environmental performance of existing buildings The Green Rating covers six core areas: energy, carbon, water, transport, wellbeing and waste ARE has assessed many of the existing commercial properties under management and all new investments using the Green Rating system Of all assets acquired since 2008, more than 20% have ""green credentials"" (eg Green Building Certification, Environmental Rating) 

From a risk perspective, Firemans Fund also houses significant green building expertise and plays a leading role in standards development, continuing to serve in 2013 as the first insurer elected to the US Green Building Councils National Board of Directors, thereby helping to shape the risk and value methodology behind the global expansion of the LEED green building standard 
Applicable sustainability standards vary around the world and within the United States, and are developing rapidly Concerned real estate managers and insurers are working with energy and building code regulators to find operating cost reductions aimed at carbon reduction and climate change objectives, alongside broader energy, environment and sustainability priorities Its essential that the insurance industry and its regulators work to consolidate and improve the many government and industry-led sustainable real estate standards, codes, and related performance and disclosure systems around common objectives and best practices, rather than create additional layers of reporting and requirements that may conflict with or duplicate existing efforts For real estate markets to internalize sustainable value drivers, the underlying standards, tools and reporting programs need to be clear and consistent 
Sustainability in 3rd Party Asset Management:
Allianz Asset Management (AAM), one of the worlds top five asset managers, is responsible for our third-party asset management business as well as for managing the majority of our proprietary assets AAM is home to two asset managers: Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) and PIMCO, a multi-asset global solutions provider 
Although these two subsidiaries have different regional focuses and investment strategies, embedding Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into asset management and offering corresponding products and services is common practice in both Building strong ESG research capabilities, engaging with the companies they invest in and pursuing active share ownership through proxy voting, are at the heart of their ESG strategies
We manage a growing portfolio of Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) By the end of 2013, total SRI assets managed by Allianz Asset Management (AAM) amounted to 957 billion, corresponding to 6% of AAMs total assets under management 
The largest share of AAMs total SRI assets under management are managed by PIMCO By the end of 2013, PIMCOs SRI investments totaled 782 billion (2012: 491 billion) In addition, Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) managed 175 billion (2012: 153 billion) of SRI investments, including the newly launched Renewable Energy Fund (AREF), which has so far attracted approximately 140mn in commitments from institutional investors 
A number of factors have driven this increase: SRI screening was introduced following a review of the investment criteria for some of the assets managed for Allianz Group; general market appreciation; and inflows of new assets from our third-party customers (including new customers) especially into fixed-income SRI products

Allianz GI:
AllianzGI seeks to be a leader in integrating ESG across the investment value chain:
1    Upstream - participating in multi-stakeholder initiatives to improve market governance
2    As an Investor - integrating ESG factors in its investment decisions
3    Downstream - encouraging improved governance and ESG performance of investee companies 
A global ESG team is responsible for ESG research, engagement and proxy voting, and ESG advisory services The teams services are utilized across our global investment platform, not just for our sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) portfolios They are also made available to the wider investment platform for use and consideration in mainstream investments
ESG Research:
Research is the cornerstone of our investment process at AllianzGI and ESG research is a component of equal importance We conduct proprietary, in-house qualitative and quantitative ESG analysis on a global universe of companies, sovereigns, covered bonds, government linked entities (agencies) and supranationals We apply both a quantitative and qualitative approach to identify and weigh material ESG factors for all business sectors and apply a best in class approach What is more, our proprietary research is also informed by external research 
Corporate Governance  proxy voting and engagement:
We have a policy in place and actively seek dialogue with companies we invest in AllianzGI has a proxy voting process in place with the Global Proxy Voting Committee and Global Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide for oversight and guidance to our Regional Proxy Voting Committees within our regional offices We want to ensure proxy voting decisions are in the best interest of our clients and take into account the most important ESG issues
When evaluating ESG issues, AllianzGI considers information from many sources, including our independent global proxy research provider, the relevant portfolio management team, the main analyst responsible for monitoring a particular company, the management of the company, and shareholder groups Engagement at AllianzGI involves two-way interaction with a company, either through presenting a viewpoint, seeking change or monitoring and documenting results We see that company engagement can improve ESG performance and reduce material ESG risks in owned companies
Beyond engagement with individual companies, other areas of ESG engagement include public policy initiatives and collective investor and multi-stakeholder engagement We feel that by selectively engagi"	4	"Investment management is an integral part of our business Understanding the extent and how climate change will impact the value of investments is crucial Concerns about climate change are changing the way assets are managed and giving rise to new and alternative asset classes, especially in the field of renewable energy and carbon investments We are committed to integrating climate change - among other environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors - into our proprietary investment strategies and third-party asset management Customer demand, a growing recognition of the importance of ESG factors and better risk-adjusted returns are sound business reasons for integrating ESG factors in our investments By scrutinizing investments from an ESG perspective, we endeavor to identify long-term risks and opportunities that are not fully reflected in market prices and seek to capitalize on them for the benefit of shareholders, customers and other stakeholders This is especially relevant to us, because as an insurance company we manage and carry risk over very long time horizons We are increasingly demonstrating our commitment to ESG by incorporating these factors in our investment strategies and asset management

Concerns about climate change are changing the way assets are managed and have given rise to new, alternative asset classes, especially in the field of renewable energy and carbon Allianz is an early investor in these new asset classes, and as a result we have already gained valuable experience and are benefiting from the opportunities they offer We see renewables as an investment opportunity with an attractive risk-return profile and are expanding our investments Investments in renewable energy projects are expected to provide sound returns in the long run (renewable energy investments with a maturity of 25+ years are typical), which fits well with Allianz's long-term investment strategy, which calls for manageable risks and attractive returns for durations of 20 years or more For these reasons, Allianz is aiming for additional volume of around EUR400mn a year in direct investments in renewable energy projects
As large institutional investors, insurance companies are important players in financing a low-carbon economy Since 2005, we have made direct investments in renewable energy projects and the total invested by the end of 2013 was EUR17 billion, making Allianz one of the largest investors in this field Our renewable energy portfolio now includes over 42 wind and 7 solar parks in Germany, France, and Italy and Sweden with a total asset base of over 1000MW of generating capacity - including 250MW from wind projects acquired in 2013 Group centers of competence like Allianz Climate Solutions and Allianz Center for Technology provide a comprehensive view of the risks associated with renewable energy technologies to ensure that Allianz's clean energy investments are sound investments with stable returns At present, Allianz's renewable energy investments are realizing return of between 6 and 8% - much higher than many other asset classes - and uncorrelated with the ups and downs of the financial markets
Investments placed on behalf of Allianz's US insurance operating entities continue to play a role in the Group's renewable energy finance position In 2012, Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America joined more than a dozen US insurance groups that invested $681 million in the Topaz Solar Farms as part of the California Organized Investment Network By producing a projected 550MW of electricity, Topaz will help the state comply with the California Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), which requires that by December 31, 2020, each California investor-owned utility must procure at least 33 percent of its retail electricity sales from renewable energy sources
In 2013, Allianz Life invested $80M in three additional renewable energy projects, including:
The Tenaska Imperial South (Csolar IV South) project - located in California's Imperial Valley - and its nearly 2 million solar panels that can generate enough electricity (130 MW) to power approximately 44,000 homes The project began full commercial operation in early November 213 and has a 25-year power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas and Electric (SDGampE)
The Solar Star projects, co-located in Kern and Los Angeles counties in California, that will deliver 579MW from more than 17 million solar modules, when complete
Continental Wind, a 667 MW portfolio of 13 operational wind farms located across the USA
Real Estate:
Allianz manages a global real estate portfolio of currently around EUR30 billion, mainly in continental Europe Allianz Real Estate (ARE), a subsidiary of the Allianz Group and a leading international real estate investment and asset manager, continues to expand its worldwide-diversified real estate portfolio Allianz Real Estate of America, acting as a principal on behalf of the Allianz Group insurance companies, makes equity investments and provides commercial mortgages in the American markets - including a US commercial loan portfolio in excess of $6 billion on behalf of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America and Fireman's Fund
Independently and as part of the Group's Risk Governance Structure as explained in response to question three (3) of this survey, ARE considers a variety of climate change -related factors when assessing potential building investments, including for example the impact of natural catastrophes and climate impacts that contribute to high risk areas that may be excluded
While adapting to physical impacts of climate change, real estate also needs to be part of the equation for climate and energy solutions - as buildings account for nearly 40% of both greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in the US, and globally An ARE pilot program in 2010 found that up to a 23 percent reduction in energy consumption and related carbon emissions could be achieved with relatively small investments Together with our tenants, we can work to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions
The ARE Sustainability Program:
ARE has a comprehensive sustainability program in place, with a focus on environmental factors, to support our Group commitment to significantly reduce carbon emissions and meet the demand for sustainable real estate
The Allianz Real Estate sustainability program focuses on our core processes and creates a baseline and standards to assess our real estate's sustainability performance Environmental factors, such as energy consumption and carbon emissions, are the main focus area, which not only help our sustainability performance but also help to reduce operating cost for tenants, many of whom are Allianz entities
The main activities of the Allianz Real Estate sustainability program are:
Create Transparency
Introduce common metrics for real estate sustainability
Assess and measure the sustainability status of ARE's real estate portfolio in a standardized way
Include sustainability in ARE's portfolio reporting
Investment Management
Include sustainability criteria in investment decision-making
Check the sustainability performance of new real estate investments as part of the acquisition process
Include energy efficiency and other sustainability topics in the due diligence process
Mandatory green building certification for new or refurbished assets (eg LEED, BREAM)
Asset management
Improve communication between ARE and tenants to improve sustainability performance
Include property-specific sustainability strategies into business plans Include energy efficiency into target setting with property and facility managers
Assess individual properties' sustainability status using the Green Rating method (see below)
Property management
Measure, collect and report building information according to sustainability metrics
Implement specific improvement measures in property planning Proactively suggest measures to further optimize buildings' sustainability performance
Working with Policymakers amp Tenants:
Although the influence of sustainable properties has yet to fully materialize in the value of real estate, we see that regulatory requirements and changing market demand, especially on the tenant side, will force real estate owners to improve the environmental impact of their portfolios in the future ARE actively engages with its tenants to further enhance the sustainability performance of its buildings - at the same time helping tenants to reduce their operating costs ARE is taking the following measures to respond to changing customer behavior within our global real estate portfolio: upgrading properties (retrofit and refurbishment), adjusting portfolio strategy, and engaging with policy makers on related code and other mandates and incentives In general, tenants are developing a growing demand for sustainable space and energy efficient space - and ARE estimates that up to 5% of its current annual asset volume is required to comply with local regulations and to attract and meet the requirements of tenants demanding sustainable and energy-efficient properties
Standards amp Ratings:
ARE is a founding member of the Green Rating Alliance (GRA), a European association of real estate owners and investors, auditors, industry bodies, measurement organizations and technology providers GRA has developed the Green Rating system, which provides a consistent approach to assessing, benchmarking and improving the environmental performance of existing buildings The Green Rating covers six core areas: energy, carbon, water, transport, wellbeing and waste ARE has assessed many of the existing commercial properties under management and all new investments using the Green Rating system Of all assets acquired since 2008, more than 20% have ""green credentials"" (eg Green Building Certification, Environmental Rating)
From a risk perspective, Fireman's Fund also houses significant green building expertise and plays a leading role in standards development, continuing to serve in 2013 as the first insurer elected to the US Green Building Council's National Board of Directors, thereby helping to shape the risk and value methodology behind the global expansion of the LEED green building standard
Applicable sustainability standards vary around the world and within the United States, and are developing rapidly Concerned real estate managers and insurers are working with energy and building code regulators to find operating cost reductions aimed at carbon reduction and climate change objectives, alongside broader energy, environment and sustainability priorities It's essential that the insurance industry and its regulators work to consolidate and improve the many government and industry-led sustainable real estate standards, codes, and related performance and disclosure systems around common objectives and best practices, rather than create additional layers of reporting and requirements that may conflict with or duplicate existing efforts For real estate markets to internalize sustainable value drivers, the underlying standards, tools and reporting programs need to be clear and consistent
Sustainability in 3rd Party Asset Management:
Allianz Asset Management (AAM), one of the world's top five asset managers, is responsible for our third-party asset management business as well as for managing the majority of our proprietary assets AAM is home to two asset managers: Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) and PIMCO, a multi-asset global solutions provider
Although these two subsidiaries have different regional focuses and investment strategies, embedding Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) issues into asset management and offering corresponding products and services is common practice in both Building strong ESG research capabilities, engaging with the companies they invest in and pursuing active share ownership through proxy voting, are at the heart of their ESG strategies
We manage a growing portfolio of Sustainable and Responsible Investments (SRI) By the end of 2013, total SRI assets managed by Allianz Asset Management (AAM) amounted to EUR957 billion, corresponding to 6% of AAM's total assets under management
The largest share of AAM's total SRI assets under management are managed by PIMCO By the end of 2013, PIMCO's SRI investments totaled EUR782 billion (2012: EUR491 billion) In addition, Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI) managed EUR175 billion (2012: EUR153 billion) of SRI investments, including the newly launched Renewable Energy Fund (AREF), which has so far attracted approximately EUR140mn in commitments from institutional investors
A number of factors have driven this increase: SRI screening was introduced following a review of the investment criteria for some of the assets managed for Allianz Group; general market appreciation; and inflows of new assets from our third-party customers (including new customers) especially into fixed-income SRI products
Allianz GI:
AllianzGI seeks to be a leader in integrating ESG across the investment value chain:
1 Upstream - participating in multi-stakeholder initiatives to improve market governance
2 As an Investor - integrating ESG factors in its investment decisions
3 Downstream - encouraging improved governance and ESG performance of investee companies
A global ESG team is responsible for ESG research, engagement and proxy voting, and ESG advisory services The team's services are utilized across our global investment platform, not just for our sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) portfolios They are also made available to the wider investment platform for use and consideration in mainstream investments
ESG Research:
Research is the cornerstone of our investment process at AllianzGI and ESG research is a component of equal importance We conduct proprietary, in-house qualitative and quantitative ESG analysis on a global universe of companies, sovereigns, covered bonds, government linked entities (agencies) and supranationals We apply both a quantitative and qualitative approach to identify and weigh material ESG factors for all business sectors and apply a best in class approach What is more, our proprietary research is also informed by external research
Corporate Governance - proxy voting and engagement:
We have a policy in place and actively seek dialogue with companies we invest in AllianzGI has a proxy voting process in place with the Global Proxy Voting Committee and Global Corporate Governance Guidelines to provide for oversight and guidance to our Regional Proxy Voting Committees within our regional offices We want to ensure proxy voting decisions are in the best interest of our clients and take into account the most important ESG issues
When evaluating ESG issues, AllianzGI considers information from many sources, including our independent global proxy research provider, the relevant portfolio management team, the main analyst responsible for monitoring a particular company, the management of the company, and shareholder groups Engagement at AllianzGI involves two-way interaction with a company, either through presenting a viewpoint, seeking change or monitoring and documenting results We see that company engagement can improve ESG performance and reduce material ESG risks in owned companies
Beyond engagement with individual companies, other areas of ESG engagement include public policy initiatives and collective investor and multi-stakeholder engagement We feel that by selectively engagi"	5357	en	mild gibberish

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

Environmental impact is factored in when making investment decisions For smaller insurance companies it is typically the case that third-party managers directly manage a large portion of the general account For the company, this is the case with our investment management approach While strategic and tactical asset allocation decisions are made on the portfolio by internal management, our investment manager helps inform those decisions
Our investment manager manages, and continues to manage the portfolio for a variety of reasons, one of which is their approach to ESG and climate change Some of the responses below provide more direct guidance into how climate change is managed directly by our investment manager

Outside of our investment managers mandate, the group attempts to diversify its exposure across the portfolio and factors in climate change as one of the existential threats to the risks in the portfolio For example, when evaluating real estate investments, particular focus is given to coastal properties that would be impacted by wind or shore erosion A majority of the direct energy exposure has been concentrated in the midstream sector Lastly, outside of our investment managers mandate, the group has promoted lending in the renewable energy sector by purchasing close to ~$40 million of USDA solar finance loans
These loans help finance the construction of rural solar development projects

Consideration of Climate Change within Fixed Income:

Climate change and other related environmental considerations are fundamentally integrated into our investment decisions Our Fixed Income team regularly evaluates the various potential costs of carbon and how it can affect capital expenditures and overall energy company profitability Our in-house investment teams generally take a broad-based approach to environmentally related evaluations including factoring in product responsibility and a companys impact on climate change When considering investments in fossil fuels, we feel it is important to balance the consideration of the current global economic dependence on energy with the need to reduce the impact of a warming planet
Climate change and rising carbon levels are significant global issues for consideration that need to be addressed by governments, by the energy industry, and by users of energy

Integration of Climate Change Risks and Opportunities within Fixed Income

Our investment managers teams generally take a broad-based approach to environmental, social and corporate risk governance (ESG) evaluation including factoring in product responsibility and a companys impact on climate change When considering investments in fossil fuels, we feel it is important to balance the consideration of the current global economic dependence on energy with the need to reduce the impact of a warming planet

We believe climate change issues can affect the risk profile of an array of issuers (including but not limited to corporates) and therefore we incorporate these into our overall investment process Assessing an issuers adoption of new regulations is one way in which we account for the transition to a low carbon economy when making investment decisions We also recognize that as climate change themes evolve, they will impact sectors and issuers at different times and in different ways As such it is important to recognize which issuers are on the right (or wrong) side of these trends, and to align when the impacts of these trends will play out with investment time horizons

Below, we outline examples where climate change issues impacted our investment decisions within our portfolios In certain industries, climate change issues are likely to be key risk and/or return drivers of the majority of names that we cover

Packaging: Several packaging companies have invested heavily in light-weighting of their products, which reduces shipping costs and reduces the consumption of carbon based raw materials, contributing to our positive bias in our research conclusions

Global Auto OEM: The global auto OEM sector faces increased carbon-related exposure driven by regulatory pressure on the industry to reduce tailpipe emissions This requires the development of new technologies, re-modelling fleets and capital investment to alter production facilities We may have a more negative view of an issuer that has failed to invest early in R&D to reduce fleet emissions and may have a more positive view of an issuer that has consistently invested in R&D ahead of the industry

Property & Catastrophe (P&C) Reinsurer: We evaluated a new issue from a property catastrophe (P&C) reinsurer with a global presence The issuer also manages catastrophe businesses for others P&C insurers typically provide probable maximum loss (PML) estimates PML is a measure of the largest loss that may occur in a particular geographic region (or entire book of business) given a specific peril of a given probability We observed that the issuer did not provide adequate PML estimates consistent with industry standards and the risks related to limited debt capacity, exposure to catastrophe zones and lack of associated disclosure were not appropriately priced in, resulting in a negative view of the issuer

Renewable Energy: In 2016, India, one of the worlds largest emitters of greenhouse gasses committed to the Paris global climate agreement, requiring 40% of its power generation to be from non-fossil sources by 2030 This provides an attractive industry backdrop for renewables in India In certain cases this provides an attractive industry backdrop for renewables in India

Utilization of Third-Party Climate Related Research & Data

The majority of our investment managers Fixed Incomes ESG assessment is conducted in- house by the investment manager The team utilizes Fluent, a platform which facilitates content management, workflow and screening for research analysts and is used as a centralized repository of all external and internally generated research Research can be stored and retrieved in a variety of ways, including ticker symbol, analyst name, investment theme, source, sector or country, making it seamless for our team members to share and retrieve all information on a company, sector or topic and further enhancing the communication lines within our teams

ESG considerations are incorporated within our fundamental research, including a designated section within Fluent (mentioned above) that captures material ESG factors Additionally, our investment managers FI team has begun providing assessments of ESG Performance and furthermore Environmental Exposure/Risk for individual issuers These ESG Performance assessments are assigned by the fundamental analysts and incorporate ESG themes, ESG related engagement and ESG third-party data that is curated from multiple sources

Investments: At Sun Life, our investment practices adopt a long-term view, and incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations when reviewing investment opportunities Investments are made after thorough research and analysis, which includes looking at a variety of relevant factors and assessing the long-term sustainability and growth of the companies and opportunities in which we invest

Our robust investment processes are designed to consider and manage numerous investment risks, including relevant ESG risks We identify material macro changes in the environment and evaluate companies changing strategies to determine whether theyve adequately identified disruptions and opportunities As these risks are identified, they are factored into our investment strategy, which is continually re-evaluated, and enables us to appropriately position our portfolio

Our Investments Team has established multiple systematic processes to help identify potential macro changes through top-down and bottom-up analysis For example, the senior members of the Investment Team attend quarterly strategy sessions where a wide range of topics are debated including current environment, economic and market forecasts, and other concerns or opportunities including, as appropriate, industry specific events The North American energy industry was a feature topic at a 2013 strategy session

Fixed income: Our Credit Analysts in our Public Fixed Income Team are responsible for monitoring companies and industries globally They are responsible for determining the appropriateness of an investment in a particular issuer, and for evaluating information on macro trends or industry shifts They regularly hold in-depth sector reviews Investments employees from the other asset classes are invited to attend these sector reviews For any macro economic or regulatory changes that we determine to be of potential environmental impact, we hold specific cross asset class discussions to share information and formulate our strategy, as well as to ensure that we are properly identifying any potential secondary risks For Private Fixed Income investments where the primary security is real estate, an important aspect of the underwriting process is an assessment of the security for existing and potential environmental risks

The Company also has in place an International Sustainability Council composed of senior representatives from key, relevant functions such as risk management, investments, finance, human resources, legal, public affairs, and shared services (including procurement and global facilities management) The International Sustainability Council periodically reports progress relating to sustainability to the senior executives of the Company The International Sustainability Council meets bi-monthly and is finalizing a new sustainability policy, which includes reference to climate change 

In general, our Enterprise Risk Framework sets out processes for risk appetite identification, measurement and assessment, response development, monitoring and control, and reporting and communication The framework recognizes the importance of risk culture in effective enterprise risk management Our risk culture is well-defined and embedded in our day-to-day business activities All business segments employ a common approach to identify, measure and assess risks, evaluate potential correlation between various risk events and categories, and monitor emerging risks and industry developments We have a process to identify and monitor emerging risks that may have a material impact on our finances, operations or reputation Management provides various risk reports to the Board, its committees and management committees including the Risk Review and Executive Risk Committees

In general, all risks are considered as part of our Enterprise Risk Framework Enterprise risk ranking and heat map covering all risks are presented at the Risk Review Committee and Executive Risk Committee on an annual basis On a quarterly basis, a key risk report, which includes the enterprise heat map and commentary thereon, is presented to the Risk Review Committee and the Executive Risk Committee and highlights key risks in current business plans and mitigating action plans New products or any product initiative where risk is assessed as high or extreme require a risk assessment to be submitted to the Chief Actuary and the Chief Risk Officer (all risks are in scope) The assessment includes a comparison to the Companys desired risk appetite and profile Finally, risk mitigation options are developed and assessed

Our risk appetite is aligned with our overall corporate vision, mission and business strategy This alignment is obtained by the consideration of key risks that we are willing to accept in order to achieve a certain level of return, and successfully achieve our stated mission to help customers achieve lifetime financial security and our business objectives These key risks include insurance risks, market risks, credit risks, liquidity risks and operational risks and we have established a range of explicit risk appetite limits and operational control points for these risks

"  As part of our work in preparing for the CDP questionnaire we looked at climate change risk under three categories:

A	Risks driven by changes in regulation

International agreements-Governments signing up to international agreements to reduce CO2 emissions could impose costs on some of our local country units Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that future legislation to reduce carbon emissions would increase our operational costs	Our approach is to monitor the development of legislation and regulation to see how they can impact our business As things develop we will refine our risk assessment Our Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs department currently monitors change in regulation and legislation There is no additional cost for them to continue monitoring changes in environmental legislation

Air pollution limits-We could be liable for penalties if we exceeded CO2 emissions set by governments As an office-based company, however, the impact is not likely to be very significant on our business-Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-Unlikely-Low Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that future legislation to reduce carbon emissions would increase our operational costs	Our approach is to monitor the development of legislation and regulation to see how they can impact our business As things develop we will refine our risk assessment Our Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs department currently monitors change in regulation and legislation There is no additional cost for them to continue monitoring changes in environmental legislation

Carbon taxes-Carbon taxes imposed on other companies could impact their long-term potential returns thereby negatively affecting their share price of the companies we invest in-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Indirect(Client)-About as likely as not-Low-medium-Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that imposing carbon taxes on companies in some industries could have an impact on their operating models and consequently the value of the company  Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

Cap and trade schemes-Cap and trade schemes imposed on other companies could impact their long-term potential returns thereby negatively affecting their share price-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Indirect (Client)-About as likely as not-Low-medium Without knowing the specifics of what future regulation could mean it is difficult to estimate the financial implications We believe that imposing carbon taxes on companies in some industries could have an impact on their operating models and consequently the value of the company Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process	This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

Fuel/energy taxes and regulations-UK Carbon Reduction Commitment  could lead to increased operational costs-Increased operational cost-Up to 1 year-Direct-Very likely-LowAs part of our CRC commitment we pay on approximately GBP 175K for allowances under the scheme In the UK we have several programs in place to help us manage our energy spend Our CO2 emissions are directly related to our energy use, consequently our approach is to manage our use of electricity and gas as well as possible We have implemented many of the programs to make our buildings as energy efficient as possible Current programs are often behavioural in nature and encourage people to use less resources

Renewable energy regulation-Alternative energy projects are often highly dependent on government subsidies and incentives Removing these subsidies could negatively impact the long-term viability of this sector and therefore impact our impact investment portfolio-Other: Reduction in value of our assets-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low  Without having more concrete information on policy regarding the stimulation of green technologies it is difficult to estimate the financial implication Removing subsidies could make the return on some investments less attractive Our portfolio managers monitor developments in this area and incorporate information into their investment decision making process	This is an ongoing process and so we do not foresee an additional internal cost for our portfolio managers to continue monitoring developments in this area

B	Risks driven by changes in physical parameters

Other physical climate drivers-Climate change can pose a significant risk to the companies in which we invest We have established a Responsible Investment Policy to incorporate environmental, social, and governance criteria into our ownership and decision making criteria Also, our Responsible Investment Committee monitors ongoing and emerging risks-Reduced stock price (market valuation)->6 years-Direct-More likely than not-Low-medium-The value of companies in carbon intensive industries may be affected if regulations change imposing a price on carbon This could have a negative impact on the value of such companies Until more information is known it will be difficult to calculate the estimated financial implication	Our responsible investment teams continue to monitor developments in this area and will adjust our investment strategy as things develop There is no additional cost of managing this risk Our portfolio managers look at environmental, social, and governance risks as part of our responsible investment policy

Uncertainty of physical risks-Climate change brings an increased risk of business interruption due to flooding or other extreme weather conditions We have developed a business disruption plan to address such situations-Inability to do business-Unknown-Direct-Unlikely-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams	There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Change in mean (average) temperature-Changes in mean temperature can result in additional heating and cooling for our offices-Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-We keep track of our energy use over time at all of our key offices While temperature changes do impact our energy bills this does not have a significant impact on our operational costs of running the business Energy costs represent a very small portion of our operational costs when compared to salaries and other expenses-Our property services teams measure our energy use on an ongoing basis and take appropriate action as necessary As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our energy use we are looking for ways to be more efficient by doing things like installing LED lights where possible There is no additional cost to tracking this risk as our property services teams area already monitoring our energy use

Change in temperature extremes-	Changes in temper-atures could result in business interruption if our employees are not able to get to work due to extreme weather conditions-Inability to do business-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-We keep track of our energy use over time at all of our key offices While temperature changes do impact our energy bills this does not have a significant impact on our operational costs of running the business Energy costs represent a very small portion of our operational costs when compared to salaries and other expenses-Our property services teams measure our energy use on an ongoing basis and take appropriate action as necessary As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our energy use we are looking for ways to be more efficient by doing things like installing LED lights where possible There is no additional cost to tracking this risk as our property services teams area already monitoring our energy use

Change in precipitation pattern-Increased risk of flooding, causing business interruption and increased claims from policy holders in our property and casualty business	Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved	Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Change in precipitation extremes and droughts-While our main business lines are life insurance and pensions we do offer property and casualty insurance in some markets Changes in precipitation patterns such as flooding and droughts could result in higher claims, thereby impacting our profitability -Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct About as likely as not-Low-Changes in precipitation patterns such as flooding and droughts could result in higher claims, thereby impacting our profitability-We manage this risk through a combination of monitoring our claims pattern in our non-life business and ensuring that our risks are appropriately reinsured so that we continue to run a profitable business Claims ratios are monitored on an ongoing risk by our risk department Our costs could risk if the risk increased and we needed to take out additional reinsurance contracts on our non-life business

Snow and ice-Heavy snowfall can result in business interruption if our employees are not able to get to work due to extreme weather conditions-Inability to do business	Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The risk of business interruption could occur at any time We have contingency plans in place to recover operations so that service to clients is not interrupted We have contracted with offsite service providers for temporary office space and staff have the ability to work remotely if necessary We have not made precise estimates of the costs involved Business interruption is a risk that is monitored on an ongoing basis by our operational risk management teams	There is no additional cost to managing this risk as our operational risk management teams are already monitoring business interruption risk as one of our ongoing operational risks

Snow and ice-Removing snow and ice also increases our operating costs, and has the potential to increase workers compensation claims due to slips and falls Increased operational cost-Unknown-Direct-Likely-Low-The cost of removing snow and ice would lead to increased operational costs and a potential increase in our workers compensation premiums should the number of claims increase These costs are not material when compared to our overall operational costs Our property services teams ensure that access to our facilities is maintained despite the weather conditions The cost of managing this risk is minimal and not something that is separately tracked by the company

C	Risks that are driven by changes in other climate related developments

Reputation-We are an office-based company and therefore not a large emitter of CO2 gases We have adopted a Responsible Investment Policy where we take environmental factors into consideration in our decision making To maintain our creditability in this area, we need to demonstrate that we are also committed to monitoring our environmental footprint  There is a direct reputational risk if we are not seen as being on the ""right side"" of the climate change debate-Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Direct-About as likely as not-Low-The potential exists that, should our reputation be damaged as a result of our activities related to the environment, our share price may be impacted As an office based company the risk of our reputation being damaged by an environmental incident is minimal compared to the risks related to our investments We have an environmental policy covering our own operations We have implemented a Responsible Investment Policy to ensure that environmental, social and governance issues are taken into consideration as part of our investment decision making process We also have a Sustainable Procurement Policy to ensure that we evaluate the environmental, social, and governance risks in our supply chain The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Fluctuating socio-economic conditions-Climate change can have a direct impact on the risks and opportunities facing the companies and countries we invest in, thereby impacting their value Reduced stock price (market valuation)-Unknown-Direct-LikelyLow-medium-The impact of climate change could negatively affect the value of some of the companies we invest in It is difficult to give a reliable estimate as to how much this would be Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Changing consumer behaviour-Climate change is also having an impact on how and where people live Movements in where people live and their economic prosperity will have an effect on demand for our products and services	Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Indirect (Client)-Likely-Low-medium-This is a long term risk and one that will be felt over the course of time The financial implications for us lie in identifying trends in the market place and adapting to them in a timely manner Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost

Changing consumer behaviour-As consumers become more aware of the impact of climate change, they may demand more products and services that are seen to address the issue If we are not in a position to provide the products and services demanded by consumers we may lose market share-Reduced demand for goods/services-Unknown-Indirect (Client)-Unlikely-Low-medium-The implications of this risk will evolve gradually over time In some cases creating opportunities for us and in others creating situations where demand for some of the products offered by the companies we invest in may change impacting the value of those companies It is difficult to point to provide a reliable estimate of the impact this will have on the value of the companies we invest in Our responsible investment teams continue to assess the impact environmental issues will have on the value of the companies we invest in They will take the necessary steps to ensure that our investment strategy is adapted to any changes that may occur as a result of developments in this area The procedures for managing this risk are already in place so there is no additional cost We currently offer socially responsible investment funds to our clients

" In terms of regulatory risks, air pollution limits, international agreements, cap-and-trade schemes, emission reporting obligations, and uncertainty surrounding new regulation could all pose a risk to the company As regulations on air pollution limits evolve to include GHGs, such as Title V Clean Air Act in the United States, there is an increased risk to ACE if clients cannot comply with the new regulations For example, as reported in the ACE sponsored paper, Global Environmental Regulation: Big Demands, Bigger Challenges, fines up to $32,000 per violation can be levied for failing to collect data or report GHG emissions International agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol; new emissions reporting obligations; and different regional emission reporting requirements, like the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, present an indirect risk to ACE These various regulations have resulted in companies that are focused on reducing emissions and/or generating emission credits under the mechanisms created by said regulations These emission reducing/credit producing projects encompass an enormous variety of technologies, some proven, some more experimental Many of these projects are located in the developing world, and the regulatory and financial framework underpinning these projects continues to undergo rapid development As a result, these projects present a unique risk profile with heightened technical, political and financial risk, which ACE assumes through its insurance products Lastly, ACE is among the largest and most advanced global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risk, with ACE Environmental Risk units in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Typical cover includes premises-based exposures, contractors and project pollution liability, professional liability, and an array of cover for environmental clean-up projects As part of the potential insureds evaluation process when seeking an applicable environmental risk transfer products, ACE considers emerging trends when finalizing contractual terms and conditions as well as pricing As regulations evolve to include GHGs, there is an increased risk to ACE is clients cannot comply with new regulations

Indirectly, due to the fact that our company provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may become more frequent or severe due to climate change, ACE experiences risk through its clients Specifically, related to precipitation extremes and droughts, the areas exposed are property and crop coverage, which collectively comprise approximately 28% of our gross written premium annually The risk is that actual losses in a given year may exceed the underlying underwriting and actuarial assumptions used to price products, thereby eroding profitability and, in extreme circumstances, shareholder capital Also, radical changes in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes, such as tropical cyclones, could jeopardize or potentially eliminate certain ACE markets through physical damage, price escalation and/or regulatory activity In addition, changes in climatology or local weather patterns may generate unpredictable patterns in hurricanes/typhoons or severe localized events such as freezing, flooding, tornadoes or hail Such unpredictability could negate the use of actuarial techniques and undermine our ability to price and risk-manage price offerings As a global property and casualty insurer, ACE is exposed to potential losses from various types of weather-related events In particular, natural catastrophe related losses are reported annually and as needed for extraordinary events or periods In 2014, ACE recorded net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $291 million compared with net pre-tax catastrophe losses of $230 million in 2013 

In ACEs own operations, offices in strategically important locations could be affected by physical risks For example, ACEs offices in New York and Philadelphia represent two of the largest regional operations in North America, with more than 1,900 employees and several of the companys senior executives ACEs offices in Hamilton, Bermuda, are the headquarters for the companys ACE Tempest Re and ACE Bermuda subsidiaries, as well as several corporate executives The Singapore office serves as the headquarters for ACEs 14-country Asia-Pacific region and houses several regional executives and a multi-country telemarketing operation Specifically, as precipitation patterns change and the severity and consistency of storms increases, there is an increased chance of flooding or snow accumulation that could affect ACE employees by limiting their abilities to commute to the office or affect ACE offices by causing power outages ACE has developed a business continuity framework to respond to any incident, including those related to climate change that may disrupt business operations, regardless of the size, scope or cause

Techniques and tools used include evaluating frequency or likelihood of various risks or opportunities along with estimated impact, plotted on a risk map to help set priorities Risk tolerances and limits are also determined, in part by dynamic financial analysis that simulates numerous events and outcomes with various levels of probability, providing confidence that the company's financial strength is adequate to pay obligations to insurance policyholders Weather-related catastrophe losses that are influenced by climate change are a prominently featured aspect in the tools and related reports assessing risks/opportunities We use catastrophe models to identify the impact of weather-related losses on our business and to identify how these losses are expected to change
We also use deterministic scenario models to look at short and long-term historical data as well as future projections over various return periods to identify areas of concern and set appropriate risk limits, underwriting guidelines, growth plans, reinsurance purchases and programs to reduce policyholder losses Our focus is on singular events as well as multiple events that could impact our company's financial results and operations over time"	283	en	clean

" Standard & Poors rating of Chubbs enterprise risk management process as Strong in its June 2018 ERM rating report places the company among the top 20% of North American and Bermuda insurers Our approach to risk management is to identify all known and emerging risks that could have an impact on overall capital levels and financial results Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulations around the world  At the board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provisions for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change 

Because the potential physical effects of climate change present a significant risk to the company, they have been integrated into Chubbs overall risk management process Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe 

We mitigate our exposure to climate change risk by actively hedging catastrophe risk in both the reinsurance and capital markets In addition, our investment portfolio, which backs the risks assumed through our insurance business, is highly diversified by risk, industry, location and type and duration of security Successful risk transfer from policyholders to insurance and capital markets also requires industry standards around exposure data We are committed to helping the industry improve standards that will ultimately help increase risk transfer capacity and provide additional incentive for risk mitigation behavior by policyholders

Chubbs process also accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Although minimal, direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur in places where Chubb has offices Chubb has developed a Business Continuity Management Program, which has been tested during severe weather events, and Chubbs operations have functioned effectively"	7	"Standard & Poor's rating of Chubb's enterprise risk management process as ""Strong"" in its June 2018 ERM rating report places the company among the top 20% of North American and Bermuda insurers Our approach to risk management is to identify all known and emerging risks that could have an impact on overall capital levels and financial results Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulations around the world At the board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provisions for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change

(ii) Our underwriting governance framework puts primary responsibility for managing individual climate change risks with the teams of underwriters responsible for each 'class' of business (such as property, liability, energy, marine, etc) written by the Group For example, an underwriter insuring a property must assess the likelihood that wind and other weather-related risks may have increased as a result of changing weather patterns This is a vitally important process in our business model
 
Opportunities arising from climate change are assessed by underwriters in much the same way  For instance, if the threat of hurricanes increases, an underwriting team will assess the additional demand in conjunction with the increased risk  

In additional to the individual judgment of our underwriters, Catlin several years ago established an Emerging Risks Committee, which is a institutionalized process for considering the impact of climate change risks, especially weather-related risks, on the company's business  The committee is chaired by the Group's Chief Science Officer and includes underwriting, actuarial and enterprise risk management (ERM) representatives  An emerging risk can be defined as an issue that could be potentially significant but which may not be fully understood in insurance terms and could affect how the company prices its products, reserves for future claims or allocates capital to specific business units

(iii) Climate change risks are assessed by each of the company's underwriters, so these risks are evaluated at an 'asset level'  This process is uniformly managed throughout Catlin's operations
 
(iv) These risks are evaluated on a daily basis; the risk must be separately evaluated for each individual policy that is underwritten as the business the company underwrites is specialized and no two policies are the same  The Emerging Risks Committee normally meets on a monthly basis, although the committee can meet more frequently depending on specific needs or the number of issues on its agenda
 
(v) The criteria for determining priorities is largely dependent on the maximum potential loss to the Group that is posed by each individual policy and, collectively, by the type of risk being considered  For example, as the company writes significant volumes of property insurance and reinsurance, windstorms (hurricanes and cyclones) pose the greatest possible maximum loss to the company The changing nature of windstorm risk due to climate change threrefore receives a very high priority

Environmental Sustainability: As a leader in social responsibility, we are employing innovation and determination to move the sustainability needle We optimized our energy performance and reduced our energy consumption across the Aetna-owned portfolio of facilities in 2012 and 2013, excluding the Coventry Health Care properties we acquired last year We saved more than 178 million kilowatt hours across the enterprise from 2011 to 2013  a 156 percent reduction over 2 years

The lynchpin of this effort is our Sustainable Data Center and Technology initiative Recognized by the Computerworld Honors Program in 2013 for using information technology to promote positive social and economic change, our green data center project enables 20 percent greater operating efficiency  adding at least a decade of life to our data centers

We also continue to invest in renewable energy, virtually doubling our annual production of electricity in 2013 to 465,000 kwh with the addition of solar panels to a second Aetna-owned facility

Building on our foundational strengths, we will continue to help improve the quality of life for the American s and people across the globe for a more sustainable future

"  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $495 billion operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,525 million operating costs in 2018

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level 

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

" Our strategic sustainability performance plan supports the environmental management of our global real estate portfolio, now comprised of both Cigna and legacy Express Scripts properties This best-in-class plan enables us to reduce our carbon footprint, eliminate operational inefficiencies, and significantly improve our energy efficiency
Our plan is focused on:
	reducing our emissions, energy, and water consumption;
	utilizing the reduce, reuse, and recycle model to minimize our waste footprint;
	increasing efficiencies in all of our building operations and investing in energy efficiency projects;
	seeking and entering into green leases that prioritize energy efficient infrastructure; and
	engaging employees and key stakeholders across the enterprise to support the goals of the strategic, sustainability performance plan

Our strategic performance plan also sets the environmental cost and conservation targets for our domestic portfolio Our 2020 environmental targets, set against our base year 2013, represent Cignas second-generation commitment to set specific, annual, and longer-term targets in the following material areas:
	Scope 1  and 2 Emissions Reduction Target 20%
	Facilities Energy Reduction Target 15%

In 2019, we worked diligently to meet our 2020 environmental targets by making strategic investments in infrastructure; closely monitoring our emissions and energy performance; aligning site-level environmental, energy, and real estate property planning systems to elevate sustainability in site management -- including gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports; and executing capital investments to support our reduction targets Cigna reports on four years of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as well as its Scope 3 business travel emissions in its annual Corporate Responsibility Report In 2019, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fifth consecutive year Similarly, in 2020 Cigna will respond to CDPs climate risk survey for the tenth consecutive year In advance of the aforementioned environmental targets expiring at the end of 2020, Cigna is developing comprehensive targets to guide our work over the next decade 

Additionally, Cigna has an overarching Environmental Policy Statement (refreshed in January 2020) The Environmental Policy Statement applies to all of Cignas global operations and board-level oversight of the policy is provided by the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors Our Environmental Policy Statement addresses our commitment to minimizing our waste footprint, including e-waste, as well as responsible energy use 

Lastly, we engage our employees on behavioral change initiatives, specifically how to integrate the principles of sustainability into decision-making processes We communicate conservation information to employees by displaying posters with facts about energy, paper, and water use and benefits of conserving and recycling in common areas in our offices such at bathrooms, near printers, and around recycling containers"	0	"Our strategic sustainability performance plan supports the environmental management of our global real estate portfolio, now comprised of both Cigna and legacy Express Scripts properties This best-in-class plan enables us to reduce our carbon footprint, eliminate operational inefficiencies, and significantly improve our energy efficiency

"  The Company is a member of the Geneva Association, which has an ongoing global initiative to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and develop strategies to enable the industry to address these impacts  

Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

¿	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
¿	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events

"	6	"The Company is a member of the Geneva Association, which has an ongoing global initiative to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the insurance industry and develop strategies to enable the industry to address these impacts
Liberty Mutual is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of ""going green and building strong"" recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
? As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of ""going green""
? IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
? Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that ""green"" building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders--for example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of ""building strong""

"  For example, recent home office remodeling and data center optimization projects will save an estimated 11,293 KWH annually which equates to eliminating 1003 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually 

In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we continue to analyze and modernize our HVAC systems by replacing old and outdated equipment with more efficient and modern designs These efforts include,
	Investing in Speed Drive controls on our equipment further reducing our energy demand
	Planning HVAC equipment shutoffs based on personnel schedules 
	Installing new speed controlled pumps to our boiler (50,000kw/yr), LED lighting upgrades (143,000 kw/yr), and continuing to improve the management of our physical plants resources (58,000 kw/yr), all have added to our goal 
Other items to note, 
	We loosened the humidity requirements in our data center allowing for less humidity in the drier months saving additional load on our HVAC systems 
	We have improved the controls on our building air pressure to keep outside conditions from leaking in when doors are opened 
	We continue to adjust our cooling towers set points to take advantage of the colder and drier days whenever possible by making colder water when it is advantageous  
	We continue to invest in the optimization of our existing controls by working with our staff and vendors to understand and adjust the Building Automation System for optimal operation of our facility  
	We are looking at installing newer more modern chemical corrosion treatment systems for our boilers and chillers which will reduce our chemical needs by keeping tighter controls on those systems, which reduces our hazardous material use and waste generation as well as reducing our use of water for those processes

Over the past six years we have made great strides in reducing our carbon footprint through reduction in utility usage Some of those key accomplishments were:
	We have converted our entire headquarters, 18 million sq ft lighting system from T12 technology to T8 electronic bulbs and ballasts 
	Modernization of our HVAC systems has eliminated ozone depleting refrigerants and installed chill water compressors that use EPA approved refrigerants along with Variable Frequency Drives on all air handler units These have reduced our electrical usage over the past six years by over 50% 
	We have reduced natural gas consumption by nearly 30% through the utilization of a computer based energy management system which now controls the starting and stopping of all fan systems 
	The company has modernized our data center using new server virtualization technology and cooling system best practices This has saved 10,506,245 Annual Kilowatts/hour and 7,23412 Total Annual Tons CO2 Emissions (equivalent to removing 1,325 cars from the road)

"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr In 2014 we replaced all of the parking lot lighting in our LEED certified Oklahoma City, OK facility with LED  Net energy savings is 133,634 kilowatts/yr  We also replaced the Lobby lighting, workstation lighting, and display case lighting with LED  We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  We will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since 2010, more fuel efficient vehicles have been purchased for the company fleet, mid-sized sedans are being used instead of full-size sedans, hybrid vehicles have been added to the fleet and the overall fleet size has been reduced Nearly 258,000 less gallons of fuel were purchased (75% reduction) between 2016 and 2017

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed five electric charging stations  at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use 

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray  We have also transitioned to xeriscape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies  Copier/printer machines in     many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the third year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities  Through YE 2016 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to 1,401 (58% reduction)  Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient  The overall result is a 2,068,445 lb (73%) reduction in CO2 emissions and a 1,313,100 kWh (71%) reduction in electricity usage over the 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping  
 
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes  

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%"	0	"As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

 We address potential impacts of climate change as part of our risk model, which draws on risk-based capital concepts In the model, risks are classified into four main categories:  Investment risks;  Pricing risks, including determination of adequate spreads or premiums, and estimation of claims, both expected and catastrophic;  Interest rate risk, including asset/liability duration matching exposures;  Other business risks, including business continuity, data security, and other operational risks The potential impact of climate change, such as hurricanes or natural disasters, is addressed in this model by reviewing geographic concentration in our investment and pricing risk assessments	1	We address potential impacts of climate change as part of our risk model, which draws on risk-based capital concepts In the model, risks are classified into four main categories: * Investment risks; * Pricing risks, including determination of adequate spreads or premiums, and estimation of claims, both expected and catastrophic; * Interest rate risk, including asset/liability duration matching exposures; * Other business risks, including business continuity, data security, and other operational risks The potential impact of climate change, such as hurricanes or natural disasters, is addressed in this model by reviewing geographic concentration in our investment and pricing risk assessments	120	en	clean
" Risks are evaluated at least annually at three governance levels, with the companys senior management actively engaged in each The companys Risk and Underwriting Committee, product boards and risk-related committees meet as frequently as monthly to evaluate specific risks and risk accumulations in Chubbs business activities and investments, while the Board of Directors Risk and Finance Committee meets regularly with company management At the Board level, the Nominating & Governance Committee charter has been amended to incorporate provision for review of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, including climate change Various risk-related reports are provided at least quarterly to business division management, product boards and other risk-related committees, senior management, the Risk and Underwriting Committee, the Risk and Finance Committee, as well as the full Board

The companys risk management process identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on Chubbs overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

In its 10-K filed each year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chubb discloses risks that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition, and identifies the occurrence of natural disasters as a key business risk The disclosure further notes that climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management and capital allocation purposes Chubb uses these models to aggregate and monitor its natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change For example, due to the fact that Earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a more short-term view of event frequency that proprietary catastrophe modeling tools address as part of their underwriting process, and we strictly regulate the concentration of those risks we are willing to underwrite 

Chubb also incorporates risk mitigation services through its risk management and site surveys; specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) Chubbs modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation  and hence price differentiation  across our client base Clients that mitigate risk  through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains  will have lower insurance costs than those that do not Chubb also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior 


The company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For Chubb to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital

According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 

With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

For example, as a company that owns or leases real property, our company has some exposure to physical risks from climate change We maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets, including coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage 

To help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of our operations, we have business continuity plans for all business critical areas as well as robust back-up systems or facilities for key principal systems and services 

In addition, we have established emergency management teams, which are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events The teams ability to respond successfully may be limited depending on the nature of the event, the completeness and effectiveness of our plans to maintain business continuity upon the occurrence of such an event, and other factors beyond our control

Our risk management team employs sophisticated weather modeling techniques to quantify the potential financial consequences of catastrophic weather events in order to evaluate the amount of capital we would need to continue to run our business if such events occur

Climate change could affect the frequency and severity of extreme weather-related events such as hurricanes, which can have a material effect on our available capital Also, if driving behaviors change such that consumers drive less or reduce commuting distances or if there is a shift toward greater usage of mass transit to slow global warming, demand for our product offering could be affected

Finally, extreme global weather volatility could increase risk financing costs Risk financing is the process by which a company secures the appropriate funds to cover unexpected financial losses arising from a risk that the company has deliberately retained Both capacity in the reinsurance market and availability of capital from the catastrophe bond market could, theoretically, become constrained after the occurrence of extreme weather events

"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings Liberty Mutual actively participates in industry organizations resulting in use of best practices through data sharing and benchmarking   

To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  

Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio    

As it builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices  Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints  With continuous improvements over time, Liberty Mutuals home office headquarters has received the LEED EB Gold certification in 2011 Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building is designed to achieve LEED Silver certification and will be nearly 20 percent more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building 

To improve the environmental impact of its daily operations, the company looks for small changes that will make a significant long-term impact  Activities such as working with contracted cleaning companies to ensure they follow environmentally-friendly procedures such as recycling plastic cleaning product containers and having the cleaners change from mops to microfiber products to use fewer chemicals in the cleaning process Another activity that further reduces energy usage and improves indoor air quality is the replacement of existing vacuum units with backpack vacuum cleaners, which are more efficient and have better dust control

As an insurance company Liberty Mutual produces large amounts of paperwork, therefore the companys Records Management department works closely with Liberty Mutuals record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction  In 2012, the company destroyed and recycled approximately 17,500 cartons of archived records  Through its secure shredding program, Liberty Mutual recycled an additional 79 million pounds of paper, which saved 67,000 trees and reduced landfill by approximately 12,000 cubic yards

Liberty Mutual has taken a leadership role in establishing compliance with office supply order minimums, which cut down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries required to service its account  In 2012, this program reduced the companys greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents) by 141,121 lbs  Furthering its office supply recycling initiative, Liberty Mutual continued its company-wide campaign to use recycled paper, which saved the equivalent of 1,080 trees in 2012, and its recycled toner program for all eligible printers to both cut down on the amount of plastic produced and reduce expenses  

Extending energy conservation beyond the office, over 98 percent of Liberty Mutuals automotive fleet consists of PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) and flex-fuel vehicles  In ongoing efforts to improve safety and reduce operating expenses, Liberty Mutual is piloting the use of telematics in company vehicles  This initiative will allow the company t manage fuel consumption on a per vehicle basis, in efforts to reduce carbon emission  The company received the 2011 Sustainability Award from the National Association of Fleet Administrators (NAFA) in recognition of its efforts to reduce consumption of fuel through changes in driver behavior in addition to the selection of alternative fuel vehicles Liberty Mutual was also the recipient of Automotive Fleet magazines 2009 Environmental Leader Award

" The need to reduce greenhouse gases is a core message of Swiss Re's public position statement on climate change and is pursued through an emissions reduction program, publications, public speaking, and other communication actions, as well as organizations of which the company is a member (eg, The Climate Group and ClimateWise) Swiss Re believes a commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint is key to having a robust and effective climate change program  Having strong credentials in the climate/sustainability area provides additional value to a company like Swiss Re as it can help attract socially responsible investors as well as make the company a more desirable place to work for top university graduates and other prospective employees  

The companies in NAIC Group 181 participate in a dedicated Climate Change strategy sponsored by the ultimate parent of the Group, Swiss Re Ltd (""Swiss Re"") A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003 Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral The plan was to do this by 2013 However, through a mix of emission reduction measures and the purchase of high quality carbon off-sets, this target was achieved in late 2007 

As part of Swiss Re's commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint we have set specific goals for a CO2 emissions intensity reduction of 506%/employee by 2013 against reference year 2003 (strengthened three times from the original 15% to its current level of 506%) and a reduction of energy intensity/employee by 20% by 2013 against reference year 2003 (a new goal set in 2008) A major contributing factor to the reduction of emissions is the company's commitment to purchase renewable energy wherever this is feasible 80% of the power consumed by our US operations comes from renewable energy By 2012 total Swiss Re group emissions have been reduced by 556% At the end of 2012, energy intensity across the Group was 424% lower than in 2003  and down by 66% from 2011 The improvement during 2012 was partly due to the fact that we were able to reap the full benefits of moving into our newly constructed, energy-efficient office building in Fort Wayne, Indiana 

In 2007, to encourage our staff to reduce their personal carbon footprints, Swiss Re introduced an employee subsidy program (COYou2 - Reduce and Gain) Subsidies of up to  CHF 5000/employee are paid for employee investment in low carbon technology To date approximately 5,750 subsidy payments have been made worldwide including over 1,750 in 2012 75 of these payments went to US based employees The top three most popular investments made in the US were in energy efficient appliances, energy efficient replacement windows and hybrid vehicles The company has also introduced an internal ""e-learning"" course for employees The course explains the climate change issue, actions which the company is taking and discusses what actions employees can take themselves 

Swiss Re recognizes that the insurance industry can reduce emissions through, for example, moving claims handling from a paper based to an electronic process In its US operations the company has operated a fully electronic claims process for many years

" The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change
The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States
Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers
Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable
Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

	Medica added CO2 monitors to the building automation system so we can control the % of outside air used based on these levels  This allows us to utilize more inside air reducing the cost of heating and cooling outside air
	Medica changed out all the fluorescent lamp fixtures with new T8 bulbs and electronic ballasts decreasing the amount of energy required to light the buildings
	Medica changed out all the high intensity lighting in the ramps and 401 garage to more energy efficient lighting
	Medica installed occupancy sensors in our offices and emergency stairwells to turn off unnecessary lighting

	Additional changes were made to both the 301 and 401 buildings that have earned us LEAD certification
	Medica have been awarded Energy Star rating each year for the past 7 years

Yes, the Group actively looks for ways to mitigate emissions in its operations  The Groups activities are based primarily in the UK and the USA  As an insurance company located within leased buildings with shared tenancy, the Groups direct environmental impacts are relatively limited, as is its ability to influence the management of the buildings as a whole The Group has, however, monitored a range of corporate environmental metrics, and calculated annual corporate GHG emissions for its principal UK office since 2008 and for its larger US offices since 2009  Those are currently Farmington, New York and Chicago and Atlanta

The key sources of emissions from the Groups US/UK offices are business travel by air and imported electricity  The imported electricity is a building management controlled service so we are unable to alter this  In addition, for business travel we seek to downgrade our flights where possible which reduce our emissions and have introduced video conferencing globally

The Group places an emphasis on reducing emissions and waste in the areas of procurement, facilities, employee transit and through participation in building initiatives

Procurement:
	When we go out to tender, we build questions into our RFPs pertaining to the suppliers environmental sustainability program
	We have current vendors supply us with sustainability reports to track various metrics (energy saved, trees saved, etc)
Examples: 
	Total Office Supply saved 117,437 lbs of wood resources for 2017
	Total Office Supply saved 34,94489 lbs of greenhouse emissions in 2017
	Staples  41% of paper have advance eco features with 8% of basic eco features

Facilities:
	Recycling:
We participate in building recycling programs as available at each location separating Waste, Plastic, Paper, Batteries, Toner, etc as specified in each location
	This year we have made an effort to gear up our recycling in all US offices, including recycling K-cups where possible; buying compostable (instead of plastic) utensils where necessary; buying wooden (not plastic) coffee stirrers
	Note that in most US offices we have eliminated buying paper cups, opting instead for mugs and glasses, unless there is a specific need otherwise
	Each US office has a loaning library set up to donate or take used books
	Most US printers are set to print in two sided format
	Office build-outs/fit-outs  we analyze sustainability and recyclability of products such as furniture, countertops, etc
	Furniture  US workstations are comprised of 54% recycled materials, and are up to 69% recyclable at the end of their useful life
	Task chairs  US task chairs (dependent on the type) are comprised of 46% to 53% recyclable material, and they are 54% to 94% recyclable at the end of their useful life 
	Transitioning to all eco-friendly products for cleaning products in all offices
Examples:
	Chairs on 2nd Floor of our London office are 85% post-recyclable at the end of their useful life
	Install LED and other energy efficient lighting where feasible We replaced light fixtures in our Philadelphia office with LED, and are doing so in Farmington, CT this year We also replaced all LED perimeter lighting in our London office

Employee Transit:
	A commuter transportation reimbursement program is available to employees for using highway commuter transit vehicles or other forms of mass transit

Participation in Building Initiatives:
	In US, participate in building sponsored green equipment waste disposal days
	Book Exchange  the London building operates a loaning library in lobby reception (donate a book or take a book)  In the US, we set up loaning libraries in each office
	Eyeglass Donation  employees can give old spectacles to lobby receptionists in the London office; London building management collects and donates them to Vision Aid Overseas

The following are the (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, Aetna does not produce products or services that lead directly to the emissions of substantial amounts of greenhouse gases or other pollutants Thus, any regulations addressing climate change will not directly impact our products and services Rather, changes in environmental laws and regulations, whether inside and/or outside the US, are likely to impact Aetna's cost of doing business indirectly in the form of higher utility costs Aetna leases the vast majority of its office locations and expects that any changes in governmental policy concerning climate change will likely impact power generation (ie, utility) companies, which can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial landlords and other property owners which, in turn, can be expected to pass on those costs to commercial tenants, such as Aetna, over time
The scarcity of wood and wood pulp products may impact Aetna in any new construction project it might in the future undertake and would also impact the cost of office supply products, such as printer paper Other raw materials may also become scarcer or more expensive in the future due to the energy cost associated with their manufacture (eg, plastic) Those in our value chain will be similarly impacted through higher energy costs associated with their operations Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers  Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors Aetna's vendors and suppliers will face higher overhead costs in the form of energy use and, where relevant, the cost of manufacture of certain items, and will be forced to pass those costs on to Aetna and other customers Aetna will be indirectly impacted by increased costs for our suppliers and vendors
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:  
At our corporate headquarters in Connecticut and in a few additional locations, Aetna possesses a modest amount of fuel burning equipment in order to handle power generation and business continuity needs in an emergency power outage situation We purchase low sulfur fuel for this equipment and would expect that any laws or regulations regarding the use of, and emissions from, this fuel burning equipment would impact Aetna directly However, based on past experience we would expect the activation and use of this fuel burning equipment to be an infrequent occurrence To help manage risks associated with a potential scarcity of office materials, Aetna has in place comprehensive recycling programs We use environmentally friendly paper for the printing of marketing materials, an effort that in 2012 helped save 302 tons of paper, and we recycle paper, carcboard, glass and plastic bottles Aetna has recycled fluorescent light bulbs since 1994, long before it was required

(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna has been unable to forecast the impact increased climate change regulation would have on our cost vs that from normal supplier variation (again, indirect costs) As discussed elsewhere (see Section 11, Energy elsewhere in this response) Aetnas energy costs, which are a direct cost, are integrated into annual budgets Any increase in fuel costs would need to be accounted for by the affected using department(s)

The following are descriptions of (i) the potential financial implications of the risk before taking action; (ii) the methods you are using to manage this risk; and (iii) the costs associated with these actions:

i) The potential financial implications of the risk before taking action:
As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, with an owned corporate headquarters in Connecticut and leased space throughout the US and internationally, we consider our company to be exposed to physical risks As a geographically diverse organization with workers located throughout the US and several overseas locations, Aetna is exposed to the physical risks of climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) Specifically, in light of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) While some of the IPCC's scientific work has been called into question by some, there is evidence to suggest at least more variability in the world's weather - a phenomenon that has been called ""global weirding""  In light of all of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location  Aetna, as well as many of its vendors, customers and suppliers in Aetna's value chain are located in geographically diverse locations that might be impacted by these risks  We consider our company as well as those in our value chain to be exposed to physical risks
Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster
(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location If Aetna and others in its value chain experience these kinds of events, then the cost of doing business is likely to increase for all Aetna has been unable to determine if these costs would increase substantially over what is currently spent
We do not expect our company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change to our business operations, revenue or expenditure for the following reasons:

Aetna has been unable to determine what other climate change related risks it would be exposed to, especially those generating a substantive change to business operations Aetna constantly monitors impact drivers to its business and has determined that those directly impacting its health care business need the most attention at the current time
Aetna has been monitoring climate change legislation and regulation over the past decades and has not been able to determine if political leadership has any better idea of what will happen than Aetna does It appears that any legislation that will occur, notwithstanding political posturing, will be slow in materializing If so, this allows Aetna time to adapt its existing business processes to account for any changes at that time

As a US-based insurance benefits corporation, with an owned corporate headquarters in Connecticut and leased space throughout the US and internationally, we consider our company to be exposed to physical risks As a geographically diverse organization with workers located throughout the US and several overseas locations, Aetna is exposed to the physical risks of climate change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) Specifically, in light of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence
(ii) The methods we are using to manage this risk:
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"") describes an accelerating transition to a warmer globe marked by more extreme temperatures and extreme weather events (eg, increases in the frequency and severity of cyclone and hurricane activity) While some of the IPCC's scientific work has been called into question by some, there is evidence to suggest at least more variability in the world's weather - a phenomenon that has been called ""global weirding"" In light of all of these predictions, Aetna's offices in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard potentially may be impacted by increased hurricane activity Aetna maintains these and other offices in support of our customers and to maintain a local market presence Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location Aetna, as well as many of its vendors, customers and suppliers in Aetna's value chain are located in geographically diverse locations that might be impacted by these risks We consider our company as well as those in our value chain to be exposed to physical risks
Aetna already has plans in place to respond to emergencies and other potential physical risks Our emergency and business continuity plans exist to ensure that Aetna is able to serve its customers without interruption regardless of natural or other disaster
(iii) the costs associated with these actions:
Aetna continues to evaluate its office location decisions based on the needs and location of our customers, the cost of doing business at a given site and other variables including the possibility of an extreme weather event which may impact our operations in that location If Aetna and others in its value chain experience these kinds of events, then the cost of doing business is likely to increase for all Aetna has been unable to determine if these costs would increase substantially over what is currently spent
We do not expect our company to be exposed to risks driven by changes in other climate-related developments that have the potential to generate a substantive change to our business operations, revenue or expenditure for the following reasons:
Aetna has been unable to determine what other climate change related risks it would be exposed to, especially those generating a substantive change to business operations Aetna constantly monitors impact drivers to its business and has determined that those directly impacting its health care business need the most attention at the current time
Aetna has been monitoring climate change legislation and regulation over the past decades and has not been able to determine if political leadership has any better idea of what will happen than Aetna does It appears that any legislation that will occur, notwithstanding political posturing, will be slow in materializing If so, this allows Aetna time to adapt its existing business processes to account for any changes at that time"	1743	en	mild gibberish

The Risk Consulting division of AXA XL works closely with corporate clients to help them translating climate hazards into a risk, which means quantifying the physical and economic impacts of climate change on their assets and business operations and implementing appropriate risk metrics into decision-making process AXA XL Risk Consulting services models the unique vulnerability of assets to hazards, eg estimate the physical damage associated to a given flood water depth, and quantify a wide range of direct and indirect economic consequences, such as the property damage associated with the said flood, the risk of disruption of the upstream supply chain or downstream distribution, the risk of interruption of production Some recent examples of analyses performed by risk consulting to support AXA XL clients are: 
	natural hazards prioritization analysis, aimed to identify regions and sites  among a clients portfolio, or supply chain  potentially more affected by natural hazards, as of today and due to climate change in the next 30 years; 
	water stress risk assessment, ie the assessment of potential water shortage and related impacts on business continuity and communities, as of today and in the next 30 years 
In addition to risk assessment, risk engineering is also able to support clients in tailoring the best risk mitigation strategy, and identify which countermeasures should be taken to control losses, or accelerate the pace and scale of adaptation, for instance reducing the physical vulnerability of assets by retrofitting, identifying alternate suppliers, creating backup stocks, or transfer risks, etc

Within AXA XL we have taken steps to encourage policyholders to reduce the losses caused by climate change-influenced events Our property risk consultants evaluate policyholders property exposures and provide recommendations to reduce the potential for property losses from natural catastrophe events (including hurricane, storm surge, earthquake and flood events) 

We have also helped our customers manage the fire peril This includes advice to reduce carbon emissions from the fires smoke plume, managing firefighting water runoff, the need to remanufacture damaged building materials, inventory, and equipment, and the need to place damaged material that cannot be recycled in a landfill 

We have approximately 300 risk professionals across AXA XL This includes Account Consultants that help clients to understand their portfolio, manage their risk and prioritize risk improvement activities; as well as Property, Machinery Breakdown, Construction and Environmental Loss Prevention Consultants in the field globally, who visit our customers key locations to help identify and mitigate risk These risks include pre-emergency planning and preparation, as well as developing recommendations on how to further improve site protection Specific areas of focus in wind-prone areas include detailed wind inspections to help our customers ensure they have the necessary protection in place to withstand hurricane-force winds Another key activity our consultants focus on is categorizing the flood hazard for every location they visit For those locations in flood-prone areas, they conduct detailed Flood Loss Estimates as well as survey current protection in place and recommend enhancements AXA XL has invested in their state-of-the-art Global Risk Maps tool, that gives consultants access to multiple flood assessment sources of information AXA XL Risk Consulting also has an active partnership with the University of Naples Federico II for flood and earthquake research

We regularly advise our clients on how to ensure that well-meaning energy saving products do not adversely contribute to a fire or make the facility more vulnerable to natural catastrophe losses We advise them on how to quickly recover from losses that do occur, which includes pre-planned and engineered environmental remediation strategies In addition, AXA XL is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS), which identifies and promotes effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss

Insurance products represent an important tool to mitigate the impacts that climate change-related events have on our clients business and on countries economies Yet the difference between economic and insured losses (the protection gap), particularly in developing markets that are disaster-prone, remains significant As an active member of organizations like InsuResilience and the Insurance Development Forum (IDF), AXA as well as AXA XL, dedicate significant efforts to help close the protection gap The IDF brings together private sector insurers, reinsurers and brokers, together with the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, with the aim to support the G20 InsuResilience objective of insuring 400m more people in emerging countries by 2020 against climate-related disasters and of improving their climate resilience AXA XL plays an active part in this  effort In addition, as Chairman of the IDF, AXA Chairman Denis Duverne regularly speaks at conferences and events dedicated to raising awareness of climate related risk in the industry and beyond

Several insurance products underwritten by AXA XL serve to encourage policyholders to become more sustainable For example, AXA XLs Environmental Liability team in France offers two biodiversity-related products: an Environmental Risks policy covering Environmental Impairment Liability and Guarantee, and a M&A Environmental policy that facilitate the rehabilitation of former polluted industrials sites and help limit artificialization of soil and biodiversity loss In 2020, AXA XL France partnered with the broker Marsh to better preserve biodiversity by encouraging clients to carry out Biodiversity impact assessments and integrate the results into their accident risk prevention and management plan Joint clients with Marsh, meeting the above criteria, are offered a 25% reduction of the deductible for Environmental Risks policies

AXA XLs North America Construction business has developed tailored Builders Risk insurance programs to address clients mass timber project risks Mass timber, which includes cross-laminated timber (CLT) is gaining popularity in North America Its also considered a more sustainable building material; according to the Wood Council, replacing steel with mass timber would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15% to 20% The process of manufacturing timber uses substantially less fossil fuel energy per unit volume than steel, concrete, or aluminum, meaning that timber has a lower carbon footprint

Within AXA XL we share internally generated thought leadership through our online magazine Fast, Fast Forward, which includes articles produced by our environmental subject matter experts In 2020 for example, the Risk Consulting team published an article about preparing industrial facilities for the effects of wildfires The full article is available here:  https://axaxlcom/fast-fast-forward/articles/preparing-industrial-facilities-for-the-far-reaching-effects-of-wildfires

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories

With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems
"	3	"The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, ""coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses"" SASB also noted that ""an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses"" and that ""the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital"" Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Program's published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
""Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well!being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a person's vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions""
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1 Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2 Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3 Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate change-related declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 2001-2002 (71%) to 2013-2014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level

"  Because it is a financial services company and not a significant source of emissions, the Company has not adopted a formal plan to reduce or mitigate them  Nevertheless, the Company takes seriously the responsibility to minimize its impact on the environment  The following highlights some of the ways the Company addresses this responsibility today

The Company has been doing business for more than 150 years and its principal offices now sit in two locations  The original home office campus sits in downtown Milwaukee and includes buildings ranging in age from 20 to nearly 100 years  Additionally, in 2002, the Company began building a second campus in Franklin, Wisconsin, approximately 12 miles from the downtown campus  At each location the Company has taken different steps appropriate to the age of the facilities
At the downtown campus, the Companys efforts have focused on renovations as well as changes in processes to promote more efficient energy usage  For example, the Company has completed several projects to reduce energy consumption, including:

	Replaced older fluorescent lighting systems with more efficient fluorescent or LED lights and new ballasts,
	Replaced air controllers with high efficiency models,
	Installed automatic sunshades in certain areas,
	Installed occupancy sensors in private offices and conference rooms,
	Recoated the entire roof of one building using a white surface to keep the building cooler in hot weather,
	Installed LED lights in parking structures of both campuses, 
	Altered HVAC schedules to decrease energy usage, and 
	Implemented an extensive energy management system at both campus which monitors daily energy usage in each building and alerts maintenance staff to out-of-pattern changes in consumption that can be promptly addressed From 2010-13, this has resulted in energy usage reductions of 87 percent in electricity, 62 percent in steam, and 266 percent in natural gas, even though occupancy rates have increased dramatically

In addition, the Company recently completed a renovation to our newest downtown building (the Van Buren building), which we expect to become LEED certified  Sustainability aspects of the project include:

	Renovating an existing building, and reusing the exterior skin, framing, structural floors, and roof decking,
	Recycling 80 percent of the construction waste,
	Replacing existing windows with new energy efficient window frames and insulating glass that is 77 percent more efficient,
	Adding insulation to the exterior building walls to improve energy efficiency,
	Locating private offices, conference rooms, and copy areas away from windows to maximize day lighting for building occupants,
	Recovering heat that would otherwise have been discharged out of the building by transferring low grade heat from electrical rooms and interior spaces to heat other areas of the building,
	In the private offices, connecting movement sensors to fan coil units, in addition to lights, to turn them off when the space is not in use,
	Using refrigerants with zero ozone depletion potential, and
	Maximizing the use of energy efficient LED lighting 

Finally, we are in the process of constructing the new Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons at our downtown campus that will incorporate numerous sustainability features  To prepare for that project, we recently deconstructed an existing building on the site and recycled over 91% of that material  

At the Franklin campus, the Company had the opportunity from the start to consider both sustainability and environmental concerns  Accordingly, this campus includes the following design and construction features:
	Environmentally conscious landscaping efforts including a bog filter system for a water feature, which naturally filters water, and the planting of 125 trees for every tree removed for construction, in addition to maintaining all on-site wetlands and prairies,
	Use of low volatile organic compound materials and paint; various products containing recycled and recyclable material; and high-efficiency window glass and shades to reduce summer heat load,
	Several mechanical innovations designed to reduce energy consumption, including a hybrid approach to an under-floor air distribution system; a chiller plant heat exchanger that allows for expanded hours of use for free cooling operational mode; and a fully integrated building automation system, and
	Some roof areas are specially coated to create a highly reflective surface that helps keep the building cool in hot weather

In addition to these efforts related to buildings and facilities, the Company seeks to mitigate its environmental impact in numerous other ways  For example, the Company has taken several steps to reduce its paper consumption, such as providing electronic pay statements to employees rather than paper paystubs and subsidizing the price of reusable coffee mugs in order to encourage employees to reduce their use of disposable cups while at work  Similarly, the Company has switched from Styrofoam and plastic to china serving wear in several hospitality areas and has arranged for a local urban produce grower to pick up the Companys spent coffee grounds for use in making compost for its gardens  Furthermore, the Company recycles hundreds of tons of paper  The Company has also implemented on-site herb and vegetable gardens at both campuses that grow produce which is used in the Companys employee cafeterias These measures will decrease the amount of waste generated by the Company  

The Company also encourages its employees to minimize the emissions associated with commuting  The Company for many years has encouraged bicycle commuting by providing a secure storage facility for bicycles and making locker and shower facilities available to interested employees  In 2014, the Company placed second in the nation for companies with more than 5,000 employees in the National Bike Challenge Additionally, the Company long has partnered with the Milwaukee County Transit System to offer a Commuter Value Pass program to eligible employees The Company pays half of the cost of a bus pass good for unlimited use on all routes and services  The Company also offers employees: certificates good toward the purchase of privately operated commuter bus tickets for those with relatively longer commutes; an intercampus shuttle program to reduce the number of cars traveling between the Franklin and downtown sites during the workday; a vanpool program; a centralized Intranet facilitation site allowing employees to match with other carpoolers and vanpoolers; a Company sponsored carpooling program which awards preferential parking spaces to participants; and a Company sponsored emergency ride home program  

As one means of quantifying the effectiveness of the Companys efforts towards encouraging its employees to minimize the emissions associated with commuting, an employee transportation survey was conducted in September 2014 at the Companys Franklin Campus   The survey calculates a percentage reduction from a baseline that assumes that every person commutes alone in a conventional vehicle to work  Of the assumed 14,040 commuting trips calculated by the survey, 5,310 trips were made in fuel-efficient vehicles, 534 trips were made via public transportation, 810 trips were avoided due to telecommuting, and 548 trips were made in a carpool  Additionally, 21 different respondents biked to work during the week of the survey, 5 respondents walked to work, and 45 respondents took the Company shuttle to work per day  These efforts resulted in around a 40% reduction in the baseline  

The Company recognizes that its policyowners have a stake in our society and its institutions  Moreover, the Companys efforts to minimize its impact on the environment align closely with its ongoing efforts to promote the efficient use of resources  Accordingly, the Company will continue to seek appropriate opportunities to lessen its impact upon the environment throughout its organization and operations

The Sustainable Investing Council decides which industries and sectors urgently require deeper analysis through an ESG Plus Study The results of the study are documented in a formal ESG Plus Analysis Module This analysis module includes recommended sustainability metrics for future consideration, but does not necessarily prescribe or restrict the investment decisions of portfolio managers The Modules are reviewed at least annually for refinement The Council meets with working teams to discuss their study findings, approve the analysis modules, and share the recommendations across all asset classes SLC Management incorporates a number of different analyses into its assessment of climate risks through both standalone analysis of physical risks by geographic region and through the assessment of carbon transition risks depending on asset class Through consistent industry-level analysis, SLCs teams evaluate the impact of climate change issues on a company's future operations Where climate risks are deemed material for an asset, SLC would develop key metrics for evaluating climate risks, revisiting the methodology at least annually

SLC Managements process analyzes quantifiable ESG concerns and combines this with a heightened awareness of non-financial risks, which are often harder to quantify and continually evolve SLC requires all investments to undergo analysis on the relevant ESG factors and the analysts incorporate those findings into their recommendations This applies to our public and private asset class portfolios

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

" Increases in energy and fuel costs may also result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers  For example, Cignas 2019 energy spend following our combination with Express Scripts is now approximately $25 million Additionally, Cignas Global Procurement and Third Party Management team now manages more than $50 billion in goods and services provided by over 13,000 suppliers globally Cigna's suppliers provide goods and services that support information technology, operations activities and internal corporate functions

Cigna also maintains a Supply Chain and Drug Procurement organization that is responsible for pharmacy network contracting, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing, and manufacturer rebate contracting for our health services business Inflationary pressures associated with climate change could also potentially impact pricing within our health services business In 2019, nearly 70% of our revenues was associated with our health services business

From a long-term perspective, the link between climate change and human health may present broader socio-economic impacts that could potentially impact Cignas cost structure within the health services that we provide For example, potential correlations have been observed between climate change with increased prevalence of respiratory, bronchial and water-borne diseases Cignas efforts to increase the quality and affordability of health care, such as our focus on preventive care and digital health, have the potential to also support climate change mitigation and adaptation

Management Methods: We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects, (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets and (3) driving innovation in the transport of pharmaceuticals

Our Global Real Estate team considers this potential risk to inform decisions on making investments in emissions reduction projects In 2019, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems  We also manage this risk through our emphasis on fleet efficiency Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles

To manage progress against our emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings  Currently, more than 50% of our United States locations are enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations

In 2019, we also identified a new lower emissions solution for shipping temperature-sensitive medications The pilot of new plant-based, recyclable cooler is made with 90% less energy than traditional polystyrene coolers, provides effective temperature control and breaks down naturally at end-of-life

Additionally, Cigna continues to participate in and support local, national, and international discussions about climate change  specifically the connection between planetary health and human health  through engagement with our community partners, business partners, industry associations, and intergovernmental organizations

Extreme Weather Events: Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and wildfires, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets Additionally, Cignas large supplier network of over 13,000 suppliers globally provide critical goods and services to support operations (including our information technology systems) Extreme weather events have the potential to cause supply chain disruptions, which could potentially impact our ability to provide health services (including pharmacy benefits) to our customers and clients

Cigna is driven by an important mission to help improve the health, well-being, and peace of mind for those we serve To deliver on our mission, we must be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail We also understand that climate change and environmental risks can pose unique challenges to clients and communities  specifically health and public health systems A recent example were the wildfires, which impacted Cignas customers in California Execution on Cigna's Customer Disaster Response Program also may result in making temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, assisting with replacement medications, transferring prescriptions, and expanding its help line to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster

Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services to members of the impacted communities We provide this access regardless of whether callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Through the Cigna Foundation, we also invest in supporting disaster relief efforts for affected communities when extreme weather events occur
The Cigna Foundation provides support to communities impacted by extreme weather events through charitable contributions and partnerships with credible, leading disaster relief organizations

Management Methods: We maintain an online Disaster Resource Center for first responders, health plan customers, and employer clients The site is continually updated by our Employee Assistance Consultant team, which has intimate knowledge of our provider network and can make real-time updates to help impacted stakeholders

Through our Customer Disaster Response Program, we offer access to trained clinician, on-site Critical Incident support, refilling prescriptions, and expanding our helpline to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for those affected

Cignas Business Continuity and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions, and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business processes The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas Data Center Recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol Cignas enterprise-wide recovery strategies are also tested on an annual basis

Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication

Our Corporate Security and Business Continuity teams work with all of our owned, leased, and managed assets that are deemed to be business critical and develop risk profiles  Based on the risk profile, a recovery time objective (RTO) is determined  this is how quickly the location has to be operating at what capacity Once the RTO is determined, appropriate business recovery solutions are designed for the location to meet that objective All managed properties are also provided an emergency preparedness guide to assist them in not only preparing for an emergency event but also for managing one as it occurs

Reputation: Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to Cignas corporate employer clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones

Also, Cignas reputation on performance related to climate change and broader environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders For example, a recent Cone study found that 83% of Gen Z respondents surveyed consider a companys purpose when deciding where to work 87% of Gen Z respondents stated that they were inspired by climate activism of Greta Thunberg 

Among investors, Cigna has observed increased investor interest in climate change and broader ESG issues over the past 12 months, even following the COVID-19 outbreak Cigna has been included in the flagship Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the past three consecutive years In 2019, we were named the industry leader for the second time in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment used to select Dow Jones Sustainability Index members

Management Methods: Guided by our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, Cigna has made continued investments since 2014 to support our energy strategy and long-term emissions reduction targets In 2019, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the fifth consecutive year 

Cigna closely monitors and responds to requests from corporate clients (including RFPs and RFIs) and requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility We also actively engage employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability programs, which include our GreenSTEPS employee engagement program In addition to being internal advocates for Cignas environmental sustainability efforts, Cignas GreenSTEPS members also engage with their communities through local environmental projects For example, members of the GreenSTEPS and Service Operations teams volunteered their time to help build the first production-scale aquaponics system near our corporate headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut 

Cigna has been a member, since inception, of the UN Global Compacts Health is Everyones Business Action Platform The platform convenes a broad coalition of stakeholders to develop and advance a global agenda for planetary health in business The work of this coalition is focused on advancing human health by addressing health determinants related to climate and the environment In 2020, this workstream is becoming integrated within the UN Global Compacts Climate Action platform

Cigna has also recently completed a multi-dimensional materiality assessment to inform the advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility platform over the next decade Through interviews, surveys, and focus groups with stakeholders across the country, we connected with employees, employer clients, customers, healthcare providers, executive leadership, our board of directors, suppliers, thought leaders, and community partners 


 
"	3	"Increases in energy and fuel costs may also result in broader inflationary pressures from our suppliers For example, Cigna's 2019 energy spend following our combination with Express Scripts is now approximately $25 million Additionally, Cigna's Global Procurement and Third Party Management team now manages more than $50 billion in goods and services provided by over 13,000 suppliers globally Cigna's suppliers provide goods and services that support information technology, operations activities and internal corporate functions
Cigna also maintains a Supply Chain and Drug Procurement organization that is responsible for pharmacy network contracting, pharmaceutical and wholesaler purchasing, and manufacturer rebate contracting for our health services business Inflationary pressures associated with climate change could also potentially impact pricing within our health services business In 2019, nearly 70% of our revenues was associated with our health services business
From a long-term perspective, the link between climate change and human health may present broader socio-economic impacts that could potentially impact Cigna's cost structure within the health services that we provide For example, potential correlations have been observed between climate change with increased prevalence of respiratory, bronchial and water-borne diseases Cigna's efforts to increase the quality and affordability of health care, such as our focus on preventive care and digital health, have the potential to also support climate change mitigation and adaptation
Management Methods: We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects, (2) tracking and monitoring our progress toward energy reduction targets and (3) driving innovation in the transport of pharmaceuticals
Our Global Real Estate team considers this potential risk to inform decisions on making investments in emissions reduction projects In 2019, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems We also manage this risk through our emphasis on fleet efficiency Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiency--the majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles
To manage progress against our emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and utility tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio - in addition to ENERGY STAR®️ ratings Currently, more than 50% of our United States locations are enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR®️ program Additionally, all 12 Cigna office locations in the United Kingdom hold ISO 50001 Energy Management System Accreditations
In 2019, we also identified a new lower emissions solution for shipping temperature-sensitive medications The pilot of new plant-based, recyclable cooler is made with 90% less energy than traditional polystyrene coolers, provides effective temperature control and breaks down naturally at end-of-life
Additionally, Cigna continues to participate in and support local, national, and international discussions about climate change - specifically the connection between planetary health and human health - through engagement with our community partners, business partners, industry associations, and intergovernmental organizations

" It is our opinion that the perils that are most volatile due to changes in climate are hurricane (due to water temperature changes) and wildfire (due to heat and drought conditions) American Family utilizes multiple catastrophe models to evaluate our risk arising from these natural catastrophe perils 

While the models continue to become more sophisticated, there is still uncertainty around the outputs For this reason, the company employs an approach that considers historical loss experience and total insured values at risk by location in addition to model output Additionally, we limit uncertainty and variability in results by ensuring high data quality of model inputs

Finally as discussed in question 3, the result of catastrophe modeling is included in our capital adequacy modeling analysis in order to provide assurance that the organizations level of capital is adequate for the catastrophe risk as well as other risks faced

As an addendum to the climate survey, below are excerpts taken from our InBusiness Sustainable
Business Awards Application
We believe there is a strong correlation between protection and sustainability and well-being We have
a dedicated sustainability specialist on staff, a full time sustainability intern, established sustainability
squads and a social media sustainability community that champions behaviors, principles and practices
serving to educate, inspire and implement new ways of doing business throughout our operating areas
We further inspire and empower employees through diversity, wellness, innovation and sustainability
programs providing opportunities to engage with what resonates most with them individually
Sustainability Plan
On a very broad level, like many key trends, sustainability is a journey It has moved from a doing what
is required to creating shared value It is an expectation equally as valued as safety, quality, and
ultimately customer and employee well-being The early stages of sustainability are about catching up
The future is about integrating sustainability into our core business Each of us has an opportunity to
think about how sustainability drives innovation and what that means for our own lives, our schools, our
communities, our business organizations and our overall well-being
Our Sustainability Plan, authored in 2008 identified 8 key objectives
1 Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
2 Reduce waste
3 Reduce water use
4 Reduce operational impact on land
5 Reduce negative environmental impact on food service
6 Enhance sustainable social practices
7 Implement sustainable economic practices
8 Advocate sustainable procurement
Each year, we use these objectives as guidelines for projects The plan keeps the greater sustainability
picture in mind, as well In addition to growing the business, we strive to be social, ethical and
environmental stewards
ENERGY USE
EPA Energy Star Portfolio
American Family is passionate about reducing our energy use All of our owned buildings are registered
in the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Energy Star Portfolio Program, which measures our
targeted energy reduction solutions (which includes high efficiency lighting, mechanical component
retrofits, and building operating adjustments) Currently three of our owned facilities are Energy Star
certified
Energy Management Strategy Team
The Energy Management Strategy Team was established in 2012, with a Facilities Program Administrator
appointed as the strategy lead This team meets biweekly In addition, subcommittees were created to
work on facets of this strategy relating to project prioritization, ideation, measurement models,
recognition and an annual scorecard We are leveraging our internal innovation platform to engage
stakeholders company-wide, vet opportunities related to energy efficiency and help prioritize those
opportunities The goal for December 2013 is to establish an ideation model that emphasizes the
people component of People, Planet, Profit
Exceed Energy Savings Goal In 2007, American Family set a goal of reducing energy consumption by 15%
by 2016 We actually met that goal four years early in 2012 and are currently in the process of setting a
new energy reduction goal
In our Wisconsin owned buildings, we have reduced overall energy usage since our 2007 baseline
This accounts for a reduction of 9,858 metric tons of CO2 emissions from Q1 2007 through Q1 2013
Data Center Upfits
One significant recent success was installing variable frequency drives in data centers and non-data air
conditioning centers to reduce energy use Because we strive for our successes to include continuous
improvement loops, we are monitoring this reduction and will make changes as needed to make this
system as efficient as possible
WATER USE
Exceed Water Savings Goal
In 2008, we set a goal of reducing our water use by 20% by 2016 We reached that goal in 2011 By
converting our cooling tower to soft water, we are saving over 7 million gallons of water per year, which
is the equivalent of 116 Olympic-sized swimming pools
Community Engagement and Awareness
Many employees volunteered for the first Monona (Wis) Water Walk in 2012, and we shared that out
through our social media Currently, we are exploring the opportunity to partner for a volunteer day
focusing on the Yahara River watershed, in the Madison area
MATERIALS CONSUMPTION
Zero Waste Initiative
Our Zero Waste Initiative is currently gaining momentum We have partnered with the City of Madison
to participate in its pilot composting program, which involves our organic waste being hauled to a
location in Columbia County Our landfilled waste is hauled to Rockford, Ill, so our carbon footprint will
decrease as the amount of organic waste hauled to Columbia County increases In the first phase of the
project, we will recycle all bathroom paper towels and pre-consumer kitchen waste at our headquarters
only This amounts to approximately one 40 yard compactor each month
Since 2007, we have reduced our landfill waste by 24% or 9,858 metric tons This was primarily
accomplished through a rigorous recycling program that in addition to single stream recycling, includes
the diversion of construction waste, furniture and scrap metal among other materials
Robust Recycling Program
American Family is committed to a dynamic recycling program Employees at the Madison-area offices
recycled over 1,167,020 pounds of paper in 2012 Based on facility occupancy of 4,300 in the Madison
area (the headquarters and a regional building), this is the equivalent to each employee recycling 270
pounds of paper per person Support for our recycling program since its start in 1989 has produced an
impressive 31,200,486 pounds or over 15,600 tons of recycled paper, generating $1,089,12600 of
combined paper rebate and landfill cost savings That's a group effort equal to saving a virtual forest of
265,204 trees Overall, the Madison area offices recycle an impressive 71% of their waste stream
Sustainable Procurement
This initiative aims to improve the procurement process by allowing purchasing agents to procure more
sustainable supplies We have found that vendors are very willing to research and offer more
sustainable alternatives to products we use every day Plans for our sustainability purchasing encompass
procurement, materials management, logistics, supply chain management and business continuity
activities The intent of sustainability purchasing is to shift spending away from goods and services that
negatively impact the environment and society towards products that are more environmentally sound
and socially and ethically beneficial
Brown Envelope Campaign
In 2012, during our second year of participating in the Madison MPower program, we initiated the
Brown Envelope Campaign to reduce our use of virgin paper The goal: to source 100% of customerfacing
paper correspondence with paper containing post-consumer recycled content We now use paper
sourced with 10% and 30% post-consumer recycled content This equates to 455 tons of paper now
sourced from post consumer recycled content, reducing 145 tons of waste and eliminating 82 cars off
the road each year (Source: EPAs Carbon Calculator)
Parallel to the brown envelope campaign, there is also an effort underway to improve our mailing
system overall in order to reduce the amount of material sent to customers This will not only make our
customers satisfied due to receiving less mail, but we will also reduce the amount of paper consumed
There has also been an increased effort corporate-wide to inform customers of our online billing option
to further reduce paper consumption
POLLUTING EMISSIONS
Solar Photovoltaic Arrays
Through targeted energy reduction solutions, American Family Insurance has reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by an estimated 7,538 metric tons which is the equivalent of over 17,5000 barrels of oil Since
2011, four of our facilities have rooftop solar power array systems which lead to savings on average of
4607 metric tons of CO2 per year
Day Cleaning
Sustainable cleaning practices have been implemented which involves day cleaning Day-cleaning is
considered a progressive and sustainable cleaning approach that contributes to reduced energy
consumption and greater social responsibility The new solution is incorporating green certified cleaning
chemicals and sustainable cleaning protocols such as use of micro fiber dusting materials and low
decibel vacuums This effort reduces the amount of electricity used after business hours and throughout
the night In addition to lowering emissions, this change also supports workforce development by
allowing housekeeping employees to live a regular schedule, which is more conducive to a happy,
healthy lifestyle
END-OF-LIFE ISSUES (areas to consider: reusability, recyclability, biodegradability)
Life Cycle Assessment
The Facilities Program Administrator is currently chartering a project to create standards for end-ofuseful-
life for equipment We currently strive to maximize equipment life by analyzing the condition of
components of various equipment and replacing components as is environmentally and economically
viable We will soon have a clear-cut, efficient infrastructure life cycle assessment tool that will improve
our ability to make sustainable choices when it comes to maintaining equipment or purchasing new
equipment
Warehouse Optimization  Office Supplies
Another program in place that focuses on end-of-life issues is our gently used office supplies program
Several employees championed the task of creating a reusable office supplies stockroom in our Mayfair
Warehouse There is an updated list of items that are available for use This program not only reduces
expenses, but it also reduces the amount of materials that need to be produced when we are able to
reuse what we already own Relating to this effort, every time the organization facilitates a move or
remodel, employees have the opportunity to repurpose gently used office supplies
Ewaste Event
Each year, there is an ewaste recycling event where employees can bring in personal electronics to
recycle at the national headquarters and East Regional Building for free In 2010, we diverted over
58,000 pounds of electronic waste  our goal for 2013 is to surpass that amount
TRANSPORTATION
Corporate Fleet
American Family Insurance has a dedicated employee on staff, our Fleet, Trucking, and Records
Retention Manager, who researches fuel-efficient vehicles, attends conferences and tradeshows, and
calculates cost-benefit analyses on fuel-efficient vehicles This manager sends out a sustainability
quarterly newsletter to the fleet drivers about fuel-efficient driving techniques in order to teach staff
about how to extend the life of the car while also polluting less and consuming less gasoline
The fleet team uses a widely respected software program to keep track of the carbon footprint of their
fleet, which produces monthly graphs showing this footprint We rank #38 on Automotive Fleet
Magazines Top 750 Green Fleets annual ranking American Family Insurance owns 1,273 vehicles; 915
of them are flex-fuel, and one is a hybrid electric vehicle
Bike Friendly Business
The national headquarters is considered a Bicycle-Friendly Business by the League of American Bicyclists
due to efforts of creating safe bike paths leading to and from the campus, offering bike racks and
shower stalls for bicyclists
Access to Public Transportation
American Family worked with the municipal public transit authority to establish a Madison Metro bus
stop right outside the main door of the headquarters during prime commuting hours, which helps make
taking the bus to and from work more convenient Our coffee shops inside the headquarters sell bus
passes to further promote public transportation as a sustainable option, and for the convenience of our
employees
OTHER  SITE AND HABITAT ENHANCEMENT
Land Management
After NHQ was built, much of the land was planted with a highway grass seeding consisting of nonnative
European grasses and forbs Not long after this, an employee spotted a Dickcissel, a native
Wisconsin prairie bird whose numbers have been declining due mostly to habitat loss Soon after that,
American Family made it a priority to maintain and improve the habitat already established and to
recover or reestablish lost habitat
The national headquarters pioneered an effort in 2009 to plant a native prairie on the grounds  the
prairie now covers 20 acres In addition to restoring the land to a prairie, we are also trying to restore
the Oak Savannah Oak Savannah is considered one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide The
only remaining pieces of it exist mostly on private land in isolated clumps Here at NHQ, we are
reintroducing the elements that formerly shaped the land in an attempt to return it to its natural state
Of these elements, the most influential is fire Every spring, a prescribed burn is carried out on a
weekend It creates an extremely nutrient-rich layer for prairie plants to establish in and thrive off
American Family works closely with wildlife ecology officials from local universities to monitor site
biodiversity Depending on location and property size, our natural surroundings are inhabited by a
considerable array of wildlife; 75 acres of land at the national headquarters have been set aside as a
wildlife retreat
Each year since 1996, the national headquarters has hired a seasonal Habitat Enhancement Intern This
person is involved in multiple site and habitat enhancement efforts including leading outdoor classroom
sessions on various land management issues, administering the bluebird nest box monitoring program
(we have 34 blue bird houses on site that volunteers check on and report to a national entity),
conducting the annual grassland bird survey, monitoring the pond for water clarity, overseeing the
annual NHQ pond fishing season, and handling fish census data The intern provides onsite education to
staff on a range of topics such as native prairie planting and species, butterfly gardens, aquatic invasives
and how to prevent them from spreading, invasive plant species and bluebird management
EPA Energy Star Portfolio
Energy Star is used to track our sustainability progress relating to utilities for all of our owned buildings
A dedicated Facilities Technician tracks all of the utility bills using Energy Star and puts the electricity
and gas use in graphs for every owned Wisconsin office, including the warehouses and airplane hangar
There are monthly facilities meetings that review the graphs to discuss trends, energy/sustainability
projects that have been completed and their impacts, and brainstorming new projects to be completed
Construction and Demolition Waste Diversion
American Family is currently in the process of developing a standard sustainability model for
construction and demolition waste when constructing or remodeling an owned office The current
Workplace Sustainability Intern is developing a waste management strategy that will be used in
accordance with LEED 10 requirements which will allow us to divert as much waste as possible from the
landfill (our current goal is a 95% diversion)
Recognition that American Family has received as a result of our companys sustainability efforts
a Green Masters Program Certification  Green Professional Award, (2012, 2011, 2010)
b MPower ChaMpions (2012, 2011)
c Bronze Level Award  Bicycle Friendly Business, from the League of American Bicyclists, awarded for

focusing on the Yahara River watershed, in the Madison area
MATERIALS CONSUMPTION
Zero Waste Initiative
Our Zero Waste Initiative is currently gaining momentum We have partnered with the City of Madison
to participate in its pilot composting program, which involves our organic waste being hauled to a
location in Columbia County Our landfilled waste is hauled to Rockford, Ill, so our carbon footprint will
decrease as the amount of organic waste hauled to Columbia County increases In the first phase of the
project, we will recycle all bathroom paper towels and pre-consumer kitchen waste at our headquarters
only This amounts to approximately one 40 yard compactor each month
Since 2007, we have reduced our landfill waste by 24% or 9,858 metric tons This was primarily
accomplished through a rigorous recycling program that in addition to single stream recycling, includes
the diversion of construction waste, furniture and scrap metal among other materials
Robust Recycling Program
American Family is committed to a dynamic recycling program Employees at the Madison-area offices
recycled over 1,167,020 pounds of paper in 2012 Based on facility occupancy of 4,300 in the Madison
area (the headquarters and a regional building), this is the equivalent to each employee recycling 270
pounds of paper per person Support for our recycling program since its start in 1989 has produced an
impressive 31,200,486 pounds or over 15,600 tons of recycled paper, generating $1,089,12600 of
combined paper rebate and landfill cost savings That's a group effort equal to saving a virtual forest of
265,204 trees Overall, the Madison area offices recycle an impressive 71% of their waste stream
Sustainable Procurement
This initiative aims to improve the procurement process by allowing purchasing agents to procure more
sustainable supplies We have found that vendors are very willing to research and offer more
sustainable alternatives to products we use every day Plans for our sustainability purchasing encompass
procurement, materials management, logistics, supply chain management and business continuity
activities The intent of sustainability purchasing is to shift spending away from goods and services that
negatively impact the environment and society towards products that are more environmentally sound
and socially and ethically beneficial
Brown Envelope Campaign
In 2012, during our second year of participating in the Madison MPower program, we initiated the
""Brown Envelope Campaign"" to reduce our use of virgin paper The goal: to source 100% of customerfacing
paper correspondence with paper containing post-consumer recycled content We now use paper
sourced with 10% and 30% post-consumer recycled content This equates to 455 tons of paper now
sourced from post consumer recycled content, reducing 145 tons of waste and eliminating 82 cars off
the road each year (Source: EPA's Carbon Calculator)
Parallel to the brown envelope campaign, there is also an effort underway to improve our mailing
system overall in order to reduce the amount of material sent to customers This will not only make our
customers satisfied due to receiving less mail, but we will also reduce the amount of paper consumed
There has also been an increased effort corporate-wide to inform customers of our online billing option
to further reduce paper consumption
POLLUTING EMISSIONS
Solar Photovoltaic Arrays
Through targeted energy reduction solutions, American Family Insurance has reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by an estimated 7,538 metric tons which is the equivalent of over 17,5000 barrels of oil Since
2011, four of our facilities have rooftop solar power array systems which lead to savings on average of
4607 metric tons of CO2 per year
Day Cleaning
Sustainable cleaning practices have been implemented which involves day cleaning Day-cleaning is
considered a progressive and sustainable cleaning approach that contributes to reduced energy
consumption and greater social responsibility The new solution is incorporating green certified cleaning
chemicals and sustainable cleaning protocols such as use of micro fiber dusting materials and low
decibel vacuums This effort reduces the amount of electricity used after business hours and throughout
the night In addition to lowering emissions, this change also supports workforce development by
allowing housekeeping employees to live a regular schedule, which is more conducive to a happy,
healthy lifestyle
END-OF-LIFE ISSUES (areas to consider: reusability, recyclability, biodegradability)
Life Cycle Assessment
The Facilities Program Administrator is currently chartering a project to create standards for end-ofuseful-
life for equipment We currently strive to maximize equipment life by analyzing the condition of
components of various equipment and replacing components as is environmentally and economically
viable We will soon have a clear-cut, efficient infrastructure life cycle assessment tool that will improve
our ability to make sustainable choices when it comes to maintaining equipment or purchasing new
equipment
Warehouse Optimization - Office Supplies
Another program in place that focuses on end-of-life issues is our gently used office supplies program
Several employees championed the task of creating a reusable office supplies stockroom in our Mayfair
Warehouse There is an updated list of items that are available for use This program not only reduces
expenses, but it also reduces the amount of materials that need to be produced when we are able to
reuse what we already own Relating to this effort, every time the organization facilitates a move or
remodel, employees have the opportunity to repurpose gently used office supplies
Ewaste Event
Each year, there is an ewaste recycling event where employees can bring in personal electronics to
recycle at the national headquarters and East Regional Building for free In 2010, we diverted over
58,000 pounds of electronic waste - our goal for 2013 is to surpass that amount
TRANSPORTATION
Corporate Fleet
American Family Insurance has a dedicated employee on staff, our Fleet, Trucking, and Records
Retention Manager, who researches fuel-efficient vehicles, attends conferences and tradeshows, and
calculates cost-benefit analyses on fuel-efficient vehicles This manager sends out a sustainability
quarterly newsletter to the fleet drivers about fuel-efficient driving techniques in order to teach staff
about how to extend the life of the car while also polluting less and consuming less gasoline
The fleet team uses a widely respected software program to keep track of the carbon footprint of their
fleet, which produces monthly graphs showing this footprint We rank #38 on Automotive Fleet
Magazine's Top 750 Green Fleets annual ranking American Family Insurance owns 1,273 vehicles; 915
of them are flex-fuel, and one is a hybrid electric vehicle
Bike Friendly Business
The national headquarters is considered a Bicycle-Friendly Business by the League of American Bicyclists
due to efforts of creating safe bike paths leading to and from the campus, offering bike racks and
shower stalls for bicyclists
Access to Public Transportation
American Family worked with the municipal public transit authority to establish a Madison Metro bus
stop right outside the main door of the headquarters during prime commuting hours, which helps make
taking the bus to and from work more convenient Our coffee shops inside the headquarters sell bus
passes to further promote public transportation as a sustainable option, and for the convenience of our
employees
OTHER - SITE AND HABITAT ENHANCEMENT
Land Management
After NHQ was built, much of the land was planted with a highway grass seeding consisting of nonnative
European grasses and forbs Not long after this, an employee spotted a Dickcissel, a native
Wisconsin prairie bird whose numbers have been declining due mostly to habitat loss Soon after that,
American Family made it a priority to maintain and improve the habitat already established and to
recover or reestablish lost habitat
The national headquarters pioneered an effort in 2009 to plant a native prairie on the grounds - the
prairie now covers 20 acres In addition to restoring the land to a prairie, we are also trying to restore
the Oak Savannah Oak Savannah is considered one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide The
only remaining pieces of it exist mostly on private land in isolated clumps Here at NHQ, we are
reintroducing the elements that formerly shaped the land in an attempt to return it to its natural state
Of these elements, the most influential is fire Every spring, a prescribed burn is carried out on a
weekend It creates an extremely nutrient-rich layer for prairie plants to establish in and thrive off
American Family works closely with wildlife ecology officials from local universities to monitor site
biodiversity Depending on location and property size, our natural surroundings are inhabited by a
considerable array of wildlife; 75 acres of land at the national headquarters have been set aside as a
wildlife retreat
Each year since 1996, the national headquarters has hired a seasonal Habitat Enhancement Intern This
person is involved in multiple site and habitat enhancement efforts including leading outdoor classroom
sessions on various land management issues, administering the bluebird nest box monitoring program
(we have 34 blue bird houses on site that volunteers check on and report to a national entity),
conducting the annual grassland bird survey, monitoring the pond for water clarity, overseeing the
annual NHQ pond fishing season, and handling fish census data The intern provides onsite education to
staff on a range of topics such as native prairie planting and species, butterfly gardens, aquatic invasives
and how to prevent them from spreading, invasive plant species and bluebird management
EPA Energy Star Portfolio
Energy Star is used to track our sustainability progress relating to utilities for all of our owned buildings
A dedicated Facilities Technician tracks all of the utility bills using Energy Star and puts the electricity
and gas use in graphs for every owned Wisconsin office, including the warehouses and airplane hangar
There are monthly facilities meetings that review the graphs to discuss trends, energy/sustainability
projects that have been completed and their impacts, and brainstorming new projects to be completed
Construction and Demolition Waste Diversion
American Family is currently in the process of developing a standard sustainability model for
construction and demolition waste when constructing or remodeling an owned office The current
Workplace Sustainability Intern is developing a waste management strategy that will be used in
accordance with LEED 10 requirements which will allow us to divert as much waste as possible from the
landfill (our current goal is a 95% diversion)

" Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting  and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope 
Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis
As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 
1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy 
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 


Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:
Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy
Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f
We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
 
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure

The Group Asset Management Responsible Investment Policy defines our commitment to sustainability The policy outlines in particular the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting (through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting Framework) and engagement

Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Sustainability Risk Framework This framework enables us to identify and analyze potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope Following a recent review, we extended our exclusion list to include companies potentially posing a significant reputational risk to investors due to controversial business activities from an ESG perspective Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, and excludes companies and countries if they do not meet the pre-defined criteria and qualitative standards

Swiss Re is committed to investing its assets responsibly via a controlled and structured investment process, integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria As part of our continuous improvement, we switched to benchmarks composed of higher ESG rated companies for our listed equity and corporate bond portfolios Thus, we apply sustainability related risk factors consistently along our entire investment process Material outcomes are incorporated into our investment decision making

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG factors that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and carbon footprints For the systematic and regular integration of such ESG factors, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio As a result, we measure our exposure to carbon emissions in listed equities and corporate bonds in a systematic manner

For our rates product portfolio that mainly includes government bonds (incl agency), we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards at country level considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view By the end of 2016, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 22% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments The total energy consumption surface in accordance with the MINERGIE® standard was 82'497 m2 at the end of 2016 In addition, more than 59'000 m2 had been sold on to third parties

Since 2015, Swiss Re has also invested in the US real estate market The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council

At the end of 2016, approximately 44% of our investment portfolio was managed externally For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG factors into this portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company This expert provides in-depth research, ratings and analysis of the environmental, social and governance-related business practices They assess our portfolios relative to traditional as well as tailored ESG benchmarks built up on the following criteria: 

	Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
	Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
	Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio For that, we work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider these ESG aspects in their investment processes The managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy, and they are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities  The next step is to provide a deep-dive analysis on the portfolio's inherent carbon emissions to get detailed transparency and to better manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change 

Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranationals and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on the Green Bond Principles Moreover, as part of our commitment to sustainability, we invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective We are well advanced in meeting our investment target for green bonds of at least USD 15bn

While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear  For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought  To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP

Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household  Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils  This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA  Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes  
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34%  
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes  The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devises have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported  However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 show no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5   Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment  However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood   If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones line Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP
Measures such as the annual mean US runoff and the percentage of streamages above bankful streamflow show no upward trend  Flood losses taken from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): http://wwwnwsnoaagov/hic/:

 
Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s  During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, but there is no evidence of any long-term change related to climate

When investigating the potential impact of climate change it is beneficial to obtain data for a longer period  NOAA has results from paleoclimatology studies that provide information on drought in North America spanning centuries   In the late 16th century there was a drought significantly more severe than anything subsequently experienced in the USA  These studies also indicate that droughts similar to the 1950s, in terms of duration and spatial extent, occurred once or twice a century for the past three centuries (for example, during the 1860s, 1820s, 1730s)
From an insurance perspective, the business line that might be most significantly and directly impacted by drought is crop insurance  Berkley insurance companies do not currently offer this coverage
Wildfire
The chart below shows acres burned per year from 1931 to 2003  It considers only protected land; if we consider all acres burned there is a very material decreasing trend   http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period  There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought
 

Based on an analysis of the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS)  wildfire losses from 1990 to 2012, on average less than 5% of the market total insured losses arise from commercial insurance  There has been no discernable trend in the share of PCS losses arising from commercial property over this period  This broader market data mirrors our own experience; Berkley companies have not seen significant losses in our own portfolio arising from wildfire events
We continue to monitor the composition of PCS losses, and our own losses as a share on PCS loss by peril, to ensure that should the current situation change we can take appropriate actions  At present, however, wildfire is not significant to us from an insured loss perspective

" The greatest insured loss potentials come from tropical cyclones, tornado, hail, winter storms, and floods Other risks include snow storms, ice storms, wild fire, and drought The physical impacts of climate change mainly pose a risk to our property insurance and reinsurance business Although the risks are global, the greatest potential impacts come from areas that are both highly exposed and have a high insurance penetration rate These include the Gulf and East coasts of the United States for the US entities (and non-US entities that write US business) in the Group

Through international affiliates, Swiss Re is also exposed to coastal and inland areas of European states (including, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) and Japan Climate risk may increase unless appropriate greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved and climate resilience measures implemented The potential impacts of climate change on human health are likely to be less visible in the short-term The greatest exposure to climate-related impacts on life and health tend to be in developing countries that have far smaller insurance markets Currently, we do not consider the risk of potential climate related losses to our life and health operations to be as high as the risk facing our property business The by far biggest loss driver remains the economic factors, ie increased values in exposed areas 

It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change, the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

As mentioned in question 2, risks (including climate risks) that could threaten our ability to function as a company across our various operating locations are assessed by our Safety and Security unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive group-wide Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local Safety and Security Officer in place All reasonable measures are taken to ensure operational effectiveness even in critical and emergency situations We do not consider climate risk to be a major threat to the operational effectiveness of Swiss Re locations Regardless, the potential for climate change to increase losses led to the development of Swiss Re's climate change strategy and provided the impetus for increased investment in climate risk research, awareness building, advocacy and reducing the company's own carbon footprint

Legislative or regulatory actions taken by Federal and State governments in response to climate change may pose new risks but also opportunities for a company like Swiss Re For example, regulation in the US or at the international level leading to an agreement on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will spur the development of renewable energy projects and may lead to increased demand for insurance products offered by our company

"  As a result, catastrophic losses from these perils in the future may be greater than those in the past due to climate change  

MetLife utilizes three independent catastrophe models in its risk analysis The starting point for using the models is having accurate property locations Almost all of the property insured by MetLife is geocoded to a street location  The Company reviews both Long Term (historical hurricanes) and Near Term (hurricanes representing the next five years of expected activity under a warm sea surface assumption) results, with and without demand surge and with and without storm surge, using each of the three models Results are produced for five separate and distinct hurricane regions The Company reviews results for deterministic events, those that have occurred in the past, as well as stochastic events for high return periods such as the 1 in 100-year, 1 in 200-year, 1 in 250-year, 1 in 500-year, 1 in 1000-year, and 1 in 2000-year probabilities  Most, if not all, of these events produce higher losses than those observed in past known storms  The Company manages to conservative return periods and purchases property catastrophe reinsurance based on the more conservative Near Term expected losses
 
Often, MetLife performs stress testing by evaluating the impact of past known significant events (eg, Hurricane Katrina or Hurricane Andrew) on the current book of business as well as modeling the impact of past known storms on other nearby areas (eg, modeling the what if scenario of Hurricane Katrina making landfall at other points on the Gulf coast) The Company also reviews the impact of various size hurricanes making landfall at various points on the coast (eg, modeling of the financial impact at every category at 10 mile increments along various points of the coast in the Northeast and Gulf, its two largest hurricane exposure zones)  Results are evaluated and considered in the purchase of reinsurance

For tornado and hail events, the Company reviews tornado/hail model results in combination with exposure concentration information and historical loss data to identify areas within states where spread of risk metrics may be changing  Concentration analysis identifies areas in tornado/hail zones that may be impacted the most by individual or possibly even several major tornadoes from the same storm  Stress tests are performed on the areas in tornado/hail zones with the greatest total insured value in small geographic areas Results are evaluated and considered in the purchase of reinsurance  

In addition to modeling, as stated above, MetLife addresses climate risk throughout its global portfolio The most substantial business decisions made for integrating climate change into MetLifes business strategy are the companys energy and GHG emissions reduction targets and climate change considerations in the insurance products provided to customers These decisions have been influenced by both the need to preserve natural resources and the potential risk of future climate change related natural disasters, respectively 

As a company, MetLife has strong risk management programs and procedures built into its businesses to evaluate and mitigate various types of risk The impact of climate change remains one of the many risks that are considered in investment decisions  In addition, MetLife has internal policies and procedures to foresee, manage and mitigate risks and events related to climate change MetLife has a Global Crisis Management Team in place in order to oversee all aspects of a crisis situation  Across its global enterprise, MetLife recognizes and implements site-specific risk mitigation and action plans at each of its individual global offices MetLife's Global Crisis Management appoints Local Crisis Management Teams to oversee risk and crisis management efforts within a country, geographic area or location and works closely with its property management partners to coordinate responses

In 2010, Securian received the Sustainable St Paul Award in 2010 for protecting and restoring the environment in the city Our sustainable practices include: 

	Cleaning products and processes that comply with strict environmental and safety standards, sanitizing our buildings to protect health without affecting indoor air quality or harming the environment 
	A combination of smart and manual lighting controls for optimal energy effectiveness 
	Optimizing hardware configuration, monitoring electrical consumption and using energy efficient methods to heat and cool servers 
	Heating and cooling our downtown campus with a locally produced, renewable energy source 
	Extensive material recycling and reclamation programs, from paper and plastic to kitchen grease Office-grade paper is shredded by a secure recycler, pulped and reprocessed 
	Participating in equipment recycling programs to keep obsolete or toxic equipment out of landfills 

Securian also supports sustainable commuting by providing: 

	Bike racks and showers provided for associates and tenants who bike to work 
	Discounted bus passes for associates 
	Vanpool Commuter Check payroll deduction program 

Securian encourages its associates to: 

	Reduce paper waste by printing on both sides of the paper and using electronic forms or PDF files when sharing documents 
	Turn off supplemental lighting when away from desk and switch off the lights in conference rooms 


Finally, Securian purchases heating and cooling services from District Energy St Paul (DESP), the largest hot water district heating system in the United States, which leads the industry in technology integration targeted to improve the efficiency and environmental profile of the system and its users   Highlights of DESPs services are:

	In its 30 years of operation, DESPs heating system operates at twice the efficiency of the former steam district heating system while using the same amount of fuel  
	Carbon emissions for the overall system have been cut in half, while the system size has almost tripled  A major component of this efficiency is the incorporation of combined heat and power as the primary heat provider to the system  This has also allowed the incorporation of approximately 250,000 tons of biomass each year, sourced from local wood residues and forestry residuals  This has resulted in significant carbon reductions per unit of energy for each customer  
	The profile of the energy from the combined heat and power facility is 1984 tons/MWhr and DESPs 2014 goal is to reach 0185 tons/MWhr
	The integration of combined heat and power for the system allows two energy products (heat and electricity) to be generated from a single source, increasing fuel efficiency, reducing costs for end users, and reducing carbon profiles in both energy sectors  
	The combined heat and power plant has also reduced sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions, carbon dioxide emissions, and the use of oil, natural gas and coal 
	In 2010, DESP also integrated the nations largest solar hot water installation  The carbon footprint from the high-performance solar thermal installation resulted in carbon emission reductions of approximately 460,000 pounds in 2012  
	DESPs cooling system has also reduced the customers environmental profile  The integration of district cooling significantly reduced the use of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) refrigerants in customer buildings and has reduced peak electricity usage through the incorporation of thermal storage
	DESPs system utilizes a fiber optic meter data collection system that is one of the most advanced in the industry  This system provides DESP with data to enable its acclaimed customer service team to help optimize building performance and provides customers with increased information to manage their building performance to meet or exceed efficiency standards

" The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change

The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States

Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers

Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable

Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including 
those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks""  We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment  By the end of 2017, we had advised 66 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 53 billion in re/insurance protection

Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks"" We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment By the end of 2017, we had advised 66 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 53 billion in re/insurance protection

Reflecting governments' growing concern over the implications of climate change, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD (wwwfsb-tcfdorg) The FSB is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, coordinating national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies Starting from the premise that climate change creates physical, liability and transition risks, the TCFD aims to develop consistent and effective financial disclosures that will allow stakeholders to properly assess the climate risks faced by companies and to take appropriate action In June 2017, the TCFD published its final recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures Swiss Re is an active member in the TCFD and has supported the development of the recommendations More recently, the TCFD is monitoring the initial implementation of its recommendations across the different sectors Swiss Re published a dedicated TCFD chapter in its Annual Financial Report launched in March 2018 In 2017, we were also part of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders organized by the WEF to urge G20 governments to formally accept and act on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures"	1098	en	mild gibberish
"  MetLife addresses climate change and implements environmental sustainability initiatives as part of its overall business strategy  Through MetLifes Sustainability Program, the Company strives to lower energy consumption, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the overall environmental impact of its global operations  

MetLifes GHG emissions reduction strategy focuses on energy efficiency and green energy purchasing for US owned-and-operated facilities while the Company has achieved emissions reductions in other areas of its carbon footprint as well In 2005, MetLife set a goal to reduce its indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 emissions) by 20 percent by 2010 (based on the 2005 baseline year) for all its US owned-and-operated office facilities This goal was achieved in 2009 and, to-date, the portfolio has reduced Scope 2 emissions by 100 percent, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by 24 percent The energy reduction was realized through capital projects and facility upgrades focused on energy savings, water efficiency, and demand metering   Although we have already made significant progress, MetLife continues to look for new opportunities to reduce its carbon footprint, to address climate change and to invest in efforts that will have a positive impact on the environment  Today, two new emissions reduction targets have been set for the Companys US owner occupied office portfolio  The first is a 5 percent reduction in energy (kWh) consumption by 2015 relative to a 2010 baseline year The second is an annual 100 percent emissions reduction for the portfolio's Scope 2 GHG emissions, to be achieved through the Companys green energy purchasing strategies 

MetLife also embeds environmental sustainability and emissions reduction programs into its overall business strategy through green procurement practices and environmental certifications (ex Energy Star, LEED, etc) at its global office facilities  Recent initiatives include MetLifes participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program, an initiative aimed at benchmarking and reducing value chain emissions  Another example is the Companys focus on improving the energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of its data center operations  In 2012, MetLifes data center at the Rensselaer Information Systems Center (RISC) in Troy, New York, became the first Energy Star-certified data center in New York State In 2013, the data center scored in the 98th percentile of existing building data centers Currently, there are less than 40 data centers with the Energy Star label and MetLifes has one of the highest rankings in the nation  The projects we implemented to reduce RISCs environmental impacts included: installing boiler system controls; upgrading lighting control panels; using waterless technology; and implementing virtualization technology, which allows the facility to share resources and save costs in energy, hardware, software licensing, and IT infrastructure maintenance
