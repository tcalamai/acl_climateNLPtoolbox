"  As a long-term investor focused on managing assets to liabilities, we believe that investors taking both financial and non-financial considerations into account when making investment decisions will be the most successful in the long term  Issues such as corporate governance, climate change, use of natural resources, health and safety, labor relations, and human rights can be important drivers of investment risk and reward

We believe that a pro-active integration of relevant Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the investment process alongside traditional financial metrics and state-of-the-art risk management practices could support our investment result  However, integration of such factors requires diligence, expertise and focus  We do not believe that simply dedicating specific investment portfolios to the latest climate branded product of the asset management industry creates sustainable value for our stakeholders and the environment

Our investments are primarily managed by third-party asset managers, and it is at this level that individual security selection decisions are made  These asset managers operate within agreed portfolio guidelines set by Farmers and take all aspects into account, both financial and non-financial, when managing Farmers individual portfolios to ensure maximum value creation 

As our core competency is selecting the right asset managers and evaluating them based on their superior investment processes, we have taken the following actions:

1)  For the procurement of new asset managers, we include questions related to the inclusion of ESG factors in the investment process into our request for proposal (RFP)

Catastrophe modeling is essential when hazards are either infrequent or historic data may
not be representative of future events Swiss Re deploys computer based risk modeling for
natural catastrophes which are continually refined and developed by a dedicated unit based
in Europe and the United States This team, the Catastrophe Perils unit, includes experts in windstorm, tropical cyclone and flooding The unit designs and maintains the models and
supports the assessment of climate related risks as a part of the process of underwriting
insurance and reinsurance business Models are regularly updated taking into account
recent events If any of these events have been influenced by climate change then the data
will be captured in the model Please see question 3 for further information

Swiss Re's modeling expertise is also used in the context of researching the potential
economic cost of future climate change under various scenarios This approach has been
utilized in Florida and the Gulf Coast Most recently Swiss Re provided the climate risk
assessment for New York City in its report ""A Stronger More Resilient New York"", mentioned
in question 6

The company encourages the management of climate related risks and the progression
towards a lower carbon economy through re/insurance products supporting the
development of renewable energy and investments in clean technologies These products
are used in the renewable energy industry to help stabilize future earnings, reduce financing costs, and increase the attractiveness of investment in clean energy, thereby promoting its deployment One example is the wind industry Swiss Re offers tailor-made structured insurance and derivative solutions to manage revenue risk resulting from uncertain wind conditions enabling better financing terms to reduce capital costs Existing wind farms and new wind projects benefit from these solutions as they reduce revenue volatility A typical wind output hedge is structured to provide certainty in production volume at single or multiple sites Swiss Re can structure a hedge with the payout based on a parametric index to compensate against shrinking operating income due to lack of or excess wind By stabilizing future earnings and cash flows, the result is reduced financing costs, increased opportunities for future investment, and an important contribution enabling the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Products using the same concept are used by clients in various renewable energy industries including, such as wind farms in Texas, hydroelectric generating facilities in the Pacific Northwest, and many other sites around the world

Re/insurance protection is an essential component for the development of renewable energy projects and therefore the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Without insurance the risks associated with the construction and operation of clean energy production facilities would make them less attractive to investors or potentially nonviable as
an investment opportunity Swiss Re offers this kind of coverage for solar, wind, geothermal, small-scale hydro-electric and bio-mass production sites

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings 

GEICO has increased the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet from 68% to 71% This has contributed to a corresponding decrease in the Running Expense for fuel to 997% below the industry average ($27149 GEICO vs $30157 Industry)  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced by 368% and the CO2 emissions have been reduced by 638%

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO is implementing water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption To conserve energy, it has implemented:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

 Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Much of the work Swiss Re does at the policy-maker level around the globe on the climate change topic aims to encourage a better understanding of the need for action as well as how the insurance industry can contribute from the perspective of a provider of risk transfer, a risk manager and as an investor Swiss Re generally works to support actions to help move the debate in the right direction rather than giving support for specific pieces of legislation For example, in Europe, we have continued to raise awareness of the important role insurers play in mitigating climate risk through different interactions with policy makers This includes speaking at industry conferences (Insurance Europe and the ABI), presenting at the European Commissions DG Climate Actions working group on Climate Adaptation and engaging bilaterally with the European Commission and national governments In the US, we have maintained regular dialogue with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), principally on climate change and natural catastrophes In Switzerland, we have provided a committee member to the OcCC (Organe consultatif sur les changements climatiques), an advisory body on climate change set up by the Swiss Federal Administration

The RE100 group, of which Swiss Re is a founding member, approaches policy-makers and regulators at the national and sub-national level to make renewable energy more available, focusing eg on countries such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa over the next three years

Swiss Re leads a regular dialogue with national and sub-national policy-makers through a dedicated unit, Global Partnerships Global Partnerships advises and develops business with governments and other public sector bodies and seeks opportunities in the microinsurance field 

In 2016, we helped to establish two significant insurance pilot programs against natural disaster risks in China Natural disasters occur frequently in China and are widely scattered They affect individuals, businesses and governments alike Up until recently, however, those at risk have largely ignored the potential financial impact of natural disasters when accounting for their financial and fiscal liabilities Moreover, they tend not to set aside any contingent capital to prepare for such liabilities For government bodies, in particular, this protection gap is highly significant as it could grow exponentially in coverage and scale in the future

When the Chinese State Council carried out a review of the insurance industry a few years ago, it identified this challenge and issued a mandate to formulate and promote natural catastrophe schemes 

In response, Swiss Re worked together with the Development Research Center of the State Council (wwwendrcgovcn/) to report on Parametric Insurance and Reform of Natural Disaster Relief Systems in China This was subsequently discussed with high-level officials and led to the development of two pilot programs in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Guangdong, which were successfully launched in 2016 Both offer protection of up to around USD 350 million, which makes them the largest commercial natural disaster insurance schemes in China to date  Both use parametric triggers, which means they can pay out quickly in the event of a disaster The first of the two programs involves the government of Heilongjiang Province and the Sunlight Agriculture Mutual Insurance Company of China It protects farmers in 28 poor rural counties of the province against the financial consequences of natural catastrophes, specifically floods, excessive rain, drought and low temperatures Combining a weather index product and a satellite-based parametric product, the program covers harm to lives and property as well as loss of income  As the program's sole reinsurer and technical adviser, we used advanced modelling techniques to design this innovative solution  the first of its kind In the second pilot, we act as sole reinsurer to protect ten prefectures of Guangdong Province against damage from tropical cyclones and excessive rainfall, in cooperation with local insurers, including the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC, wwwpicccom) This, too, is a parametric product, using rainfall and wind speed indices to allow for faster payouts Having quick access to emergency funding after a natural disaster is particularly important in Guangdong It is one of China's most important economic hubs and home to many global companies, but faces a severe natural disaster risk

In 2016, the Centre for Global Dialogue organized the Agricultural and Natural Catastrophe Insurance Forum to discuss the underlying challenges, assess possible solutions and share experiences Nearly 40 Chinese government officials and insurance professionals met with international experts to explore the feasibility of introducing parametric solutions across China, drawing on the learnings offered by the two pilot projects in Heilongjiang and Guangdong In addition, experts from Swiss Re and other organizations elaborated on the latest developments in flood risk management, catastrophe bonds, agricultural and aquaculture insurance, and public-private partnerships

Memberships of organizations such as The Climate Group allow for periodic dialogues on climate-related topics, (predominantly resilience and risk transfer themes) with regional, national and state governments which are also members In the area of resilience building, at the UN climate summit in September 2014, Swiss Re pledged its financial capacity as well as its expertise to help nations increase their climate resilience through the following commitment: ""By the year 2020, Swiss Re commits to having advised 50 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience, and to have offered them protection of USD 10bn against climate related risks""  We have agreed with the United Nations to report publicly on the progress we make on this commitment By the end of 2016, we had advised 26 sovereigns and sub-sovereigns on climate risk resilience and offered them a total of USD 39 billion in re/insurance protection

A national backstop for state catastrophe funds that is fully funded by a portion of private insurance premiums would increase the private insurance market's ability to respond to large-scale natural catastrophes The plan we support would not eliminate private reinsurance, which allows insurance companies to spread the risk of catastrophic losses and which is essential to the private insurance market Private reinsurers will continue to play an integral role in the insurance market, and private reinsurers will be encouraged to participate in providing capacity to the national backstop This plan would spread risk even more and provide a guaranteed source of reinsurance protection after major events or a series of events that could destabilize the market or even threaten a private market collapse

Regulatory risks
As a global life and health insurer and wealth and asset management company, we do not anticipate being directly impacted by climate change regulations in the near term  However, certain assets in our investment portfolios could be subject to increased regulation which may result in increased operating costs  This could include, for instance, carbon pricing regimes imposed on our oil and gas investments or energy efficiency requirements in our real estate portfolio  We monitor the regulatory environment on an ongoing basis and do not deem (potential) regulations to have a material impact on our company at this time

Physical risks
Manulifes operations and investments are diversified across many sectors and geographies  So while this may expose Manulife to the effects of an environmental event in one region, its holdings in any affected region are limited and circumscribed  Nonetheless, extreme weather events may pose operational risk to Manulife and as such, we have in place business continuity procedures and regularly perform concentration risk assessments on our operations  Any financial risks of environmental impacts are further minimized through insurance and reinsurance

Other risks
Manulifes reputation may be adversely affected if it is not perceived to be taking meaningful action to help address climate change  Changing client behavior may impact demand for certain products  As an example, large corporate tenants are increasingly seeking out more environmentally sustainable office space (see answer to Question 5 for more detail)

Bankers considers modeled and historic loss trends to determine reinsurance structure and attachment/limit, and incorporates these factors into our risk management strategies  They are also used to determine levels of reinsurance and capital requirements to mete claims needs, pricing adequacy for catastrophic costs and to set guidelines to mitigate catastrophe exposures

Most catastrophe models today are approved by regulators and are generally developed using the latest weather and climate data and science, tested by metrological, engineering, computer science and actuarial experts  The models often create alterations that account for perils where they believe future losses may deviate substantially from historical trends, specifically for Hurricanes  In these cases, Bankers considers the potential impact on the catastrophe loss distributions shown by these models

Furthermore, Bankers also takes into consideration different assumptions of Hurricane frequency and severity to match both the historic and the potential future hazard trends to test the impact of climate change on loss distribution  In addition to assumption sets created by model vendors, Bankers models scenarios of past severe events to determine the impact of prior storms on the current portfolio  Finally, Bankers considers deterministic scenarios to identify the potential impact of a worst-case scenario across its portfolio  The results of these stress tests are evaluated when deciding the best risk management strategy for the company, reinsurance purchases and growth plans and projections

Property insurance is an annual product, therefore, pricing underwriting and reinsurance and risk management strategies must evolve over the course of the year to match the changing market and climate environment As such, Bankers considers our view of risk as informed by the catastrophe models, to represent the most up-to-date view of the current environment for catastrophe events that may impact the portfolio  Consequently, the effects of climate change are accounted for on an ongoing basis, as the potential effect become known"	7	"The company utilizes catastrophe models to determine the extent of, plan for and measure weather related events Consideration is gen to climate change to the extent that it is considered by the third party models that Bankers uses to review ""warm sea-surface temperature"" or ""near-term"" views in these models to provide correlation to historical trends

Swiss Re's property and casualty business is written using the four-eye principle: transactions must be approved by at least two authorized individuals  with the exception of single risk acceptances, which can be authorized by one underwriter, with the four-eye principle taken care of by spot checks after acceptance Each underwriter is assigned an individual underwriting authority based on technical skills and experience; any business exceeding this authority triggers a well-defined escalation process

"  However Homesite does encourage policyholders to prevent or mitigate losses caused by covered perils, whether or not the losses could be attributed to climate change  This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane  For customers in areas prone to hurricanes and wildfires, Homesite sends informational emails and tweets that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils at the start of the season as well as several times during the season  In addition, Homesite posts similar informational articles on its website  At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event

Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
   
A few states (incl Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

In 2014, our parent American Family, partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support researchers over the next 25 years in making residential roofs last longer and leak less often ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen small roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters

"  The Group includes several large subgroups of companies as well as a number of smaller subgroups and companies that operate independently While some of the larger subgroups own their own buildings and can thus have maximum control of their physical operations, many of the companies lease or rent the properties in which they operate, and therefore have less control of the physical aspects of their operations

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings

GEICO has continued to increase the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced and as a result the CO2 emissions have been reduced The company is exploring the use of diesel and hybrid vehicles to further reduce emissions The company is also increasing the use of van pools for employees

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO has implemented water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption In its continuing efforts to conserve energy, GEICO has implemented the following changes in its corporate headquarters during the past year:

1)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old centrifugal chillers with brand new centrifugal chillers  
2)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old boilers with brand new boilers
3)	Replaced all 3M window film throughout the entire facility with 486,000 useable sf
4)	Replaced all mushroom parking lot lights with LED mushroom lights  This was in excess of 200 fixtures

Previous activities related to energy usage reduction relate to:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Deployment of new energy-wise vending machines

The following projects are in progress:

1)	Replaced the 20+ year old Building Automated System (BAS) that controls all HVAC throughout the facility  This Phase 1 projects to cut all main constant running AHU over to VFD technology to permit ramping up to the building HVAC load versus running continuously at full speed is 60% complete 
2)	Install window shades to compliment the window films ability to reject heat from the sun further reducing our cooling load on the building  This project will be completed in November

We will continue to mitigate our risks (eg, not writing homeowner policies in hurricane-prone coastal states or those at high risk of wildfire) as they emerge  

California Casualty models a number of perils (fire-following EQ, tornado/hail, winter storm, and hurricane, and wildfire) which could be affected by climate change Given our improved surplus position, we increased our retention from $10 million to $14 million for our 2021 Catastrophe reinsurance program

Climate change, including global warming and sea-level rise, is expected to result in increased annual variability in weather-related events, including wildfires, convective storms, winter storms, hurricanes and floods   Damage resulting from such events is generally covered by policies underwritten by California Casualty members and California Casualty has instituted a number of methods to limit its exposure to such losses, including the following:
1	Product Distribution 
a	Auto-only in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas
2	Product
a	Several years ago, in 20 wind-prone states, older home roofs are covered at ACV, instead of at replacement cost We continue to replace the ACV roof coverage with scheduled roof coverage in wind-prone states to further reduce wind losses In addition, the scheduled roof coverage has been expanded to additional states
3	Underwriting 
a	Minimum distance-to-coast underwriting acceptability rules for Property risks located in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia
b	Use of ISO Fire Line to qualify new Property risks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming 
4	Pricing 
a	Effective 4/1/2014, rates are varied by ISO Fire Line scores in California Subsequently, Fire Line score rating was implemented in nine states
b	In new rating plans, rates are varying by roof type and age  Effective dates vary by state
c	Introduced higher deductible options
d	Starting from 4/1/2014, the company has been rolling out new by-peril rating plans for homeowners policies As of 6/30/2021, 33 states have this plan, which represent 99% of the homeowners policies
e	Starting from 12/1/2021, the company plans to further refine its rating plans by splitting its rating perils  As a result, wildfire and weather-related water damages will be rated separately
5	Monitoring exposure concentration

Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong

" This could result in an increase in both the magnitude and volatility of losses due to severe weather events Ensuring adequate pricing for natural catastrophe risks could become more challenging, particularly given the existing regulatory regime

Severe weather-related events of concern, such as hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, and tornados, are localized, short-term weather-related events that are a second order impact of a warming global climate While it is logical to assume that a warmer climate would increase the amount of atmospheric energy available for the formation of localized, short-term severe weather events, the precise impact to the frequency and severity of such events relative to historical levels is uncertain

The understanding of the impact of climate change on wildfires is still developing throughout the insurance industry, but warmer temperatures and drought are likely to create conditions for more and potentially larger fires New models are being developed along with the advancement in science on such climate effects 

Increases in property catastrophe risk associated with climate change will manifest themselves gradually over a period of many years (decades), while insurance policies are usually of one-year duration This allows Liberty Mutual the opportunity to adjust rates, coverages and underwriting guidelines as required in response to trends that demonstrate an increase in the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophe events The Company will continue to closely monitor trends in catastrophe loss frequency and severity, and to employ the latest generation of computer modeling tools to estimate exposures to natural catastrophe events, adjust pricing, and revise underwriting guidelines as necessary 

Future pricing must be sufficiently flexible and continuously incorporate the latest trend data and scientific advances in catastrophe modeling to ensure adequate risk adjusted returns on capital A significant concern is the potential for a wide divergence in the future between the consensus view of natural catastrophe risk between insurers and the regulators with authority to approve changes to pricing Many current regulatory regimes do not allow sufficient flexibility to ensure that pricing is set at actuarially sound levels, and in effect set price controls that are slow to react to changes in risk levels Should the Company be unable to raise rates consistent with any increases in natural catastrophe risk, the only viable strategic option may be to significantly restrict the amount of business written in certain markets, or possibly to exit certain markets altogether

The geographical areas impacted by climate change risk are generally those that are currently at the greatest risk for the natural catastrophe perils described above (eg, the East Coast and Gulf for hurricanes; the Central and Southern US for tornados and severe thunderstorms; and the Western US for wildfires) Any increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes may expand the boundaries of the geographic areas that are susceptible to each peril, but the areas indicated above are likely to continue to be of highest risk

"  Through its efforts, Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for seven buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 
To meet the guidelines for these standards, the company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms  
Liberty Mutuals focus on energy reduction initiatives is ongoing and with a continued strong focus on implementing building operating best practices, the company continues to drive down its overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio    
As it builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices  Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints  Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
At the companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light  Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month as compared to the old metal halides  Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 288-watt LED lights in its Weston office parking lot
In addition to an office furniture donation program, Liberty Mutual has also recently piloted two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility that it plans to roll-out to its Plano, TX and other facilities within the year  The programs are:
	Each week the company donates prepared food that was not served to Lovin Spoonfuls, which delivers the food directly to local homeless shelters and soup kitchens
	The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes  The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
	Old office furniture and supplies from the Boston, Weston and NH offices is donated to the Furniture Trust

As an insurance company Liberty Mutual produces large amounts of paperwork  Therefore, the companys Records Management department works closely with Liberty Mutuals record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction  Through its secure shredding program, in 2015 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,842 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 4,115,467 pounds of CO2 avoided (the equivalent of 398 cars taken off the road), 47,692 trees saved, and approximately 14,211 cubic yards of landfill space conserved  
Liberty Mutual has also taken a leadership role in establishing compliance with office supply order minimums, which cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries required to service its account Further, Liberty Mutual purchases office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer recycled content  These initiatives have saved 315,175 gallons of water, 692 trees, 65,451 pounds of CO2 and 62,106 kWh    
Liberty Mutuals PrintSmart Program has reduced printed paper by 32 million pages during 2015 which has conserved 33M gallons of water, saved 3,840 trees and reduced CO2 emissions by 455 tons
In 2015, 72% of all Liberty Mutual marketing collateral was printed on demand  with preferred printing partners or downloaded to a desktop  If users choose to print, systems route the order to the closest print facility based on the ship-to zip code, resulting in faster delivery and reduced freight travel distance, thereby, lowering carbon emissions  
Extending energy conservation beyond the office, over 98% of the companys automotive fleet consists of PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) and flex-fuel vehicles  In 2015, the company reduced its fleet by 5%, reduced business miles driven by 4%, and transitioned 48% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles  These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 23713 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2014 to 2015 
Liberty Mutual has received numerous awards for its sustainability practices including: 
	2015 Champions of the Environment Award from the New York City College of Technology Foundation
	2014 Preservation Achievement Award from the Boston Preservation Alliance
	2012 Facility Management Achievement Award for Best Practices, Sustainability Award  from the International Facility Management Association (IFMA) Boston

Climate-related risks are systematically assessed during risk and underwriting process Priority is given to factors that could have the largest or most immediate financial impact, supplemented by research into climate change and its impacts Various units contribute to the assessment, including Group Sustainability Risk, which coordinates Swiss Re's climate change response Emerging Risk Management identifies and assesses new or emerging risks, including those climate related Catastrophe Perils unit designs and maintains loss models and supports the assessment of climate related risks as part of the underwriting process 

Swiss Re's property and casualty business is written using the four-eye principle: transactions must be approved by at least two authorized individuals  with the exception of single risk acceptances, which can be authorized by one underwriter, with the four-eye principle taken care of by spot checks after acceptance Each underwriter is assigned an individual underwriting authority based on technical skills and experience; any business exceeding this authority triggers a well-defined escalation process

Large individual transactions that could materially affect the Group's and Business Units risk exposure require independent review and sign-off by Risk Management before they can be authorized This is part of our three signature approval process (involving Swiss Re's underwriting, client management and risk management functions) that establishes the accountability of each of the parties for significant transactions We monitor accumulated exposure to single risks or to an underlying risk factor on a Group-wide basis We further manage our risk by external retrocession, risk swaps, or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities

Priorities are determined by the potential impact of risks Risks include any change that could have a short or long term negative impact on our business (eg the financial impact of insured losses) or alter our understanding of that risk  The risk assessment process described above is aimed at protecting Swiss Re's capital base by avoiding the acceptance of too much business that is exposed to the impacts of severe weather or other potential loss factors Another priority is potential reputation risk if business were accepted that included unacceptable practices relating to general environmental operating practices Swiss Re introduced its Sustainability Risk Framework process to minimize this kind of potential reputation risk

Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process

The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer that outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk Framework (http://mediaswissrecom/documents/2016_corporate_responsibility_report_swissre_crr16pdf, see p 28) This framework consists of country and company exclusions, as well as eight policies on sensitive topics like oil and gas, mining, and an overarching environmental protection policy Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope

The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, who is advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of Swiss Re's responsible investment activities, and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities 

In 2007 we signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and in 2012 the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), thereby formally endorsing our commitment to corporate responsibility The PRI and PSI are taken into account in Swiss Re's comprehensive responsible investment framework As a PRI signatory we provide in-depth reporting on our responsible investment activities The report is available on the PRI website at https://wwwunpriorg/signatory-directory/?co=&sta=&sti=&sts=&sa=join&si=join&ss=join&q=swiss+re

Priorities are determined by the potential impact of risks Risks include any change that could have a short or long term negative impact on our business (eg the financial impact of insured losses) or alter our understanding of that risk The risk assessment process described above is aimed at protecting Swiss Re's capital base by avoiding the acceptance of too much business that is exposed to the impacts of severe weather or other potential loss factors Another priority is potential reputation risk if business were accepted that included unacceptable practices relating to general environmental operating practices Swiss Re introduced its Sustainability Risk Framework process to minimize this kind of potential reputation risk
Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process
The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer that outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets
Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk Framework (http://mediaswissrecom/documents/2016_corporate_responsibility_report_swissre_crr16pdf, see p 28) This framework consists of country and company exclusions, as well as eight policies on sensitive topics like oil and gas, mining, and an overarching environmental protection policy Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope
The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, who is advised by the Asset Management Executive Team and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, oversees and monitors the progress of Swiss Re's responsible investment activities, and ensures that our commitment is reflected in our day-to-day activities
In 2007 we signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and in 2012 the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), thereby formally endorsing our commitment to corporate responsibility The PRI and PSI are taken into account in Swiss Re's comprehensive responsible investment framework As a PRI signatory we provide in-depth reporting on our responsible investment activities The report is available on the PRI website at https://wwwunpriorg/signatory-directory/?co=&sta=&sti=&sts=&sa=join&si=join&ss=join&q=swiss+re"	1040	en	mild gibberish

	Attached to this survey as Exhibit 2 is a summary describing the Companys Environment and Energy Policy



The sustainability concept has been embedded in MAPFREs values since its origins, and is expressly included in its Code of Good Governance The Environmental Policy, which all of the Group's employees must adhere to and respect, is the expression of this commitment to sustainable development, which is also enshrined in MAPFRE's Code of Ethics and Conduct
MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy is based on three cornerstones: 



















 
ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees
(GRI: 414-417, FS4; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year

OPERATIONAL RISKS
 
STRATEGIC AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RISKS
 
The risk policy and the systems in place to manage and control risk are outlined in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (pages XX of the Annual Accounts) 
For environmental risks, MAPFRE has an Environmental and Energy Policy defined and a Safety and Environmental Committee responsible for its implementation It also contributes towards the efficient management of environmental risk in company by launching products and services which meet its customers needs

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to reduce its electrical consumption From an investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage technology for cooling its buildings, to upgrading building fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, replacing much of its florescent lighting with efficient LED lighting, and the installation of white roofs on buildings to lower heating and cooling requirements, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption The culmination of these and other energy conservation projects resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the seventh consecutive year for The Hanover owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines In addition, for the past six consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed on The Hanovers 800K square foot Worcester headquarters campus is offset by purchasing certified Renewable Energy Certificates This commitment equates to over 80% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers 14M square foot office portfolio 

The company also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For almost 15 years, The Hanover has worked diligently to strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling programs, where in 2015, our headquarters office recycling efforts included: 122 tons of mixed fiber, cans, plastic and glass recycled; 34 tons of composted material; 25 tons of electronics; and 39 tons construction and demolition material In total, these recycling efforts successfully diverted in excess of 44% of the total waste stream away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as well, as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover supports the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions At its headquarters offices in Worcester, The Hanover has partnered with Mass-Rides, a ride-matching service sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, which rewards employees for walking, biking, telecommuting, carpooling, vanpooling, taking transit, or working a compressed week With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our Worcester headquarters With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work schedules which allow many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our roadways For these efforts, The Hanover has earned the ECO leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover hosts an Employee Earth Day Celebration to educate and showcase its commitment to energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at The Hanover, but in their everyday lives 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most importantly, our sustainability program makes a meaningful impact to reduce The Hanovers carbon footprint Secondly, weve seen material energy savings and utility cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability efforts as part of their criteria for job opportunities

	Disparate impact of climate change on certain insured segments either directly such as agriculture or through regulation (eg heavy industry due to emissions)  These insured segments could be significantly impacted which could in turn affect the companys business; and
	Availability and cost of risk transfer options (Reinsurance, Cat Bonds, Cat Swaps, etc) 

As we go to market with different initiatives, geographic diversification is one of the factors taken into consideration  Additionally, Nationwide maintains sizable investment portfolios which might be impacted by climate change  Therefore, consideration is given to the potential impacts of climate change on the investment portfolio

" Globe Life Inc desires to be a responsible citizen of the communities it inhabits and to be a good steward of natural and monitory resources  With those goals in mind, Globe Life Inc management has emphasized energy conservation through various upgrades to the McKinney TX building systems, IT/Computer systems and employee awareness initiatives Some of those initiatives are  

Building Utilities (specifically electricity consumption) 

	Replaced a cooling tower in the building with a new high efficiency variable speed unit which uses less electricity and water
	Added timers and programmable set back controllers to control HVAC systems which allow us to turn off cooling during non-business hours and during winter when cooling demands are less
	Utilize lower wattage high efficiency fluorescent lighting in all areas
	All PCs and network copiers/printers are set to auto-sleep mode
	As CRT monitors fail, they are replaced with Energy Star rated LCD monitors
	Employee awareness  encourage all employees to conserve energy both at work and at home
	Light fixtures in the building are on switches that are programmed to turn off if there is inactivity in the area
	Trees and landscaping around the perimeter of the buildings are designed to shade the building to reduce cooling loads
	Replaced our physical IT server environment with a virtualized server environment This upgrade to IT systems is expected to reduce electricity usage

Recycling  

	We monitor print and are committed to reducing the amount of print generated in our operations through the use of electronic communications and reporting We also work to identify print that can be eliminated or reduced
	Paper correspondence received is imaged and filed electronically This allows us to recycle virtually all of the paper received or produced
	Recycling was a focus in the design and materials used in the new building For example, the terrazzo flooring in the new building is made from recycled porcelain plumbing fixtures and the carpeting was manufactured by InterfaceFLOR using 25% post consumer or bio based materials 
	Personal hygiene products used in the restroom facilities are manufactured from recycled or renewable resource paper products

Water Conservation  
	All of the fixtures in the McKinney Texas restroom facilities are low flow fixtures
	Landscaping has been designed using primarily low maintenance native plants to reduce water consumption Sprinkler systems are on timers

General  
	During the COVID 19 pandemic, approximately 80% of office personnel are currently working remotely from home or other locations since the end of March 2020  Under normal circumstances, the Companies encourage employees to remain on site and conserve fuel by providing an employee lunch room in which local restaurants cater in lunch

"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

We have installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions), and have replaced existing parking lot lighting fixtures with more energy efficient LED light fixtures  In Austin, TX we are presently converting our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In Wilmington, DE, we are in the process of converting all office light fixtures from standard fluorescent lighting to energy efficient LED lights; projecting a $700,000 savings over the next 10 years  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Miles driven in 2013 were 34% lower than miles driven in 2010  A 42% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this four year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies   Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping   

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint 
 
For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  operationally printing of customer transactional documents on lighter weight paper (transitioning from 20# to 18# or 16#); changing the operation from chemical-based inks to soy/water-based inks; Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, active operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%"	0	"As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

In its role to evaluate risk to the enterprise, the BOD conducts sessions on risk topics, including on climate risk

To ensure the BOD and executive management receive information about emerging risks, the enterprise has a process in place to identify and assess all risks faced, including financial, operational, technology, regulatory/legal and strategic risks  New and evolving risk identification is conducted in conjunction with strategic planning  Risks identified can include those due to changes in processes, new strategies, or external factors such as the changes to the industry and the way we conduct business  One of the risks is the impact of severe weather events  While this risk is one that is continuously monitored in the organization, the ERM process considers changes to experience, computer models, and trends identified by experts through ERMs networking and involvement in professional organizations  Exposures are evaluated in relation to capital quarterly to ensure the risk is within tolerance, and therefore, within the stated enterprise risk policy appetite and tolerance

American Familys investment managers take the issue of climate risk into consideration in the same manner as any other potential drivers of risk and return in the investment portfolio  Investments are managed to ensure the organization can respond in the event of a natural catastrophe

i) the scope of process:
At AIG PC, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses and a key element of our approach to corporate governance

We have an integrated, multi-disciplinary process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material, risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather

To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate PML (probable maximum loss), monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change

ii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:
Risks or opportunities related to climate change are assessed at the company level through a multi-layered risk management organizational structure  AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Finance and Risk Management Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board  Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimizing intrinsic value, and protecting AIGs reputation among key stakeholders The management committees that support the GRC are charged with identifying, analyzing and reviewing specific risk matters within their respective mandates, and are comprised of senior executives and experienced business representatives from a range of functions and business units throughout AIG and its subsidiaries

AIG PC considers climate change as it relates to future risk exposures through an Environmental Working Group (EWG), made up of senior staff from across the organization, including Enterprise Risk Management Following assessments of recent natural catastrophes, AIG recognizes the impact of environmental change on the risk profile The EWG was established to develop a framework for AIG PC to establish a view on the impact and risk of anthropogenic environmental change and its impact on AIGs business This includes better understanding what the climate science indicates about changes to the environment and a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile

An example of a climate change-related (non-hurricane) risk identification and analysis currently being undertaken by AIG PCs Catastrophe Management and Analytics Center of Excellence is the Climate Informed Global Flood Risk Assessment  The project is developing innovative modeling frameworks for local and global flood risk estimation, and supporting them through the integration of rainfall simulation, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, statistical models, key topography, asset, population density, climate and other socio-economic data bases This will provide a robust platform for the best possible flood risk estimates in a changing climate for actuarial and portfolio analysis using all information sources as they are updated  The project methodology will be applied to several global regions where recent mega-floods have led to concerns, and test the predictive analysis by focusing on key attributes of different settings of interest The model is also intended to assess the financial impacts of flooding of assets at risk within the region(s) for which policies are written, or whose disruption (eg, transportation networks) would result in business disruption or loss of use claims

iii) how risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level, but the AIG PC EWG is comprised of members from throughout AIGs individual asset levels and business units who may elevate relevant climate-change related risk information up to the enterprise risk level for assessment as appropriate

At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events In fact, the impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

iv) the frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):
Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) The AIG PC Environmental Working Group monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including identifying climate change related risks and opportunities

v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIGs Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer"	2	"i) the scope of process:

v) criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM ERM supports AIG businesses and management in the embedding of enterprise risk management in all of our key day to day business processes and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing and mitigating the risks taken by us and our businesses
Accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit
vi) to whom are the results reported:
The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receive updates from AIG's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function and review the results of stress tests Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit Progress and results of the Environmental Working Group are reported to the Chief Science Officer"	1274	en	mild gibberish

" The greatest insured loss potentials come from tropical cyclones, tornado, hail, winter storms, and floods Other risks include snow storms, ice storms, wild fire, and drought The physical impacts of climate change mainly pose a risk to our property insurance and reinsurance business Although the risks are global, the greatest potential impacts come from areas that are both highly exposed and have a high insurance penetration rate These include the Gulf and East coasts of the United States for the US entities (and non-US entities that write US business) in the Group

Through international affiliates, Swiss Re is also exposed to coastal and inland areas of European states (including, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) and Japan There is already a high level of climate risk in many regions This will increase unless appropriate greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved and climate resilience measures implemented The potential impacts of climate change on human health are likely to be less visible in the short-term In the US, Westport Insurance Corporation writes employer stop loss and HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) reinsurance Potential insured losses are most likely in industrialized countries due to the high levels of insurance penetration The greatest exposure to climate-related impacts on life and health tend to be in developing countries that have far smaller insurance markets Currently, we do not consider the risk of potential climate related losses to our life and health operations to be as high as the risk facing our property business

It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change, the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

As mentioned in question 2, risks (including climate risks) that could threaten our ability to function as a company across our various operating locations are assessed by our Safety and Security unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive group-wide Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local Safety and Security Officer in place All reasonable measures are taken to ensure operational effectiveness even in critical and emergency situations We do not consider climate risk to be a major threat to the operational effectiveness of Swiss Re locations Regardless, the potential for climate change to increase losses led to the development of Swiss Re's climate change strategy and provided the impetus for increased investment in climate risk research, awareness building, advocacy and reducing the company's own carbon footprint

Legislative or regulatory actions taken by Federal and State governments in response to climate change may pose new risks but also opportunities for a company like Swiss Re For example, regulation in the US or at the international level leading to an agreement on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will spur the development of renewable energy projects, and may lead to increased demand for insurance products offered by our company
"	3	"The greatest insured loss potentials come from tropical cyclones, tornado, hail, winter storms, and floods Other risks include snow storms, ice storms, wild fire, and drought The physical impacts of climate change mainly pose a risk to our property insurance and reinsurance business Although the risks are global, the greatest potential impacts come from areas that are both highly exposed and have a high insurance penetration rate These include the Gulf and East coasts of the United States for the US entities (and non-US entities that write US business) in the Group
Through international affiliates, Swiss Re is also exposed to coastal and inland areas of European states (including, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) and Japan There is already a high level of climate risk in many regions This will increase unless appropriate greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved and climate resilience measures implemented The potential impacts of climate change on human health are likely to be less visible in the short-term In the US, Westport Insurance Corporation writes employer stop loss and HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) reinsurance Potential insured losses are most likely in industrialized countries due to the high levels of insurance penetration The greatest exposure to climate-related impacts on life and health tend to be in developing countries that have far smaller insurance markets Currently, we do not consider the risk of potential climate related losses to our life and health operations to be as high as the risk facing our property business
It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change, the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs Our facility in Caledonia, MI has upgraded the energy management system in 2018 in a variety of different ways We are expecting approximately $100,000 reduction in annual energy consumption due to installation of 25 variable frequency drives, HVAC specific motion sensing devices and chilled water reset controls We have reduced occupied (on times for HVAC and lighting) by 110 hours per month and retrofitted atrium lights to LED to eliminate labor costs and 24 hour run times on common area lighting In addition, we installed new LED light panels in the kitchen area and saw an 85% reduction in energy consumption To ensure ongoing success, we complete quarterly audits of HVAC and lighting schedules to ensure systems are going into setback modes during after-hour periods in both Caledonia, MI and also Lake Mary, FL buildings In Caledonia, we have implemented energy tracking and monitoring to help measure and manage utility consumption Over a year time period, electricity consumption is down by 14%

Our Caledonia, MI and Woodland Hills, CA offices participate in composting and compost approximately 10,400 pounds of food and coffee ground waste annually per site

In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since 2010, more fuel efficient vehicles have been purchased for the company fleet, mid-sized sedans are being used instead of full-size sedans, hybrid and electric vehicles have been added to the fleet and the overall fleet size has been reduced Over 485,000 less gallons of fuel were purchased (134% reduction) between 2017 and 2018

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  Farmers has also installed ten (8 in Southern California and 2 in Phoenix) electric charging stations to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use In Los Angeles, we provide a company stipend to employees for alternative travel

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray  We have also transitioned to xeriscape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies We have set an internal goal to reduce print for internal purposes by 80% and are implementing a variety of actions to help achieve this goal  Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color   Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the fourth year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities  Through year end 2018 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to slightly over 400 Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes

We have also set a goal to eliminate single use plastic from our internal operations and are working with our vendors to implement this goal and replace single-use plastic materials with alternative, environmentally friendly materials
In 2018, Farmers also created a customer paperless campaign Farmers worked with American Forests, the countrys oldest nonprofit conservation group, to encourage customers to go paperless As a part of the campaign, in the month of September, as customers would switch to a paperless policy and/or paperless billing during, Farmers would donate $1 to plant one tree, up to $25,000

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%"	0	"As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

The Company has implemented a variety of initiatives and policies designed to help control costs and reduce the environmental impact of our operations  These initiatives include the use of Rideshare plans, fleet emission management, and environmental considerations in the selection of vendors and suppliers

We file Rideshare Plans for each office with over 250 employees in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties  In many instances, the Auto Club and the Exchange share facilities, allowing these plans to cover both entities  Annually, these plans are submitted to, reviewed and approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District  The plans provide strategy, implementation and results of achieving average vehicle ridership goals for employees commuting into those large offices on a regular basis  Some specific segments of the plan include financial and non-financial incentives for those who carpool, vanpool, use public transportation, bicycle, or walk to work in lieu of driving a vehicle as a single passenger In 2018, the Auto Club provided financial incentives for those who drove electric vehicles and utilizes more efficient process for the employees The objective of these plans is to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads during the prime morning commutes and thus reduce emissions and greenhouse gases    

In a separate but related matter, we have a fleet of approximately 550 company vehicles in California, 408 of which we use for our Insurance Operations  We have progressively operated more fuel efficient and lower emission vehicles in this fleet  Each year we review a plan including what vehicles we need to continue to operate and/or will be acquiring as older vehicles need replacement  The vehicles have migrated from Low Emission to Ultra Low Emission to Super Ultra Low Emission to Partial Zero Emission and even Zero Emissions over recent years  The objective is to lower costs, use less fossil fuel and reduce emissions and greenhouse gases emitted from these vehicles In our California operations, we have a total of 247 Ford CMax hybrids, 95 Ford Fusion hybrids and 3 Freightliner diesel hybrid large trucks  Additionally, the Auto Club has 7 Smart Fortwo 100% electric vehicles These vehicles are being used in our fleet for Insurance Claims adjusters, Special Events and Procurement 

To service the fleet as well as other electric vehicles the Auto Club has installed a total of four, dual port, fixed EV charging stations  One of the charging stations is located at our headquarters in Los Angeles at the corner of Adams and Figueroa, and another at our Costa Mesa Branch Office These stations are available for public use The other two charging stations are installed at our Administrative Office for fleet and employee use only The use of these electric charging stations is free encouraging our employees to personally drive plugin hybrids or 100% electric vehicles to and from work Since the installation of these stations, we have seen a rapid rise in employees driving electrified vehicles to work thus reducing emissions We are working with Southern California Edison to install two additional, dual port, fixed EV charging stations, at our Los Cerritos and Upland branches These will be DC Fast Charge stations and will be available for public use

We work closely with vendors and utility companies to procure and utilize the most energy efficient (low emission) equipment possible and look for ways to reduce the actual consumption  We continue to replace equipment that is the least efficient based on age and performance At our large administrative facilities we utilize contemporary building management systems and more energy efficient chillers that responds to the actual load required (variable speed drives) All new and renovated facilities are designed to be fully compliant with Title 24 regulations, including HVAC technology and light harvesting techniques  We are monitoring our energy consumption with a third-party vendor  This allows us to focus our capital investments on replacing equipment that is inefficient based on performance to reduce costs and consumption

Information Systems has adopted hardware standards that reduce our need to implement physical equipment  We continue to reduce our physical footprint by embracing newer server technology such as virtualization, which reduces our overall power and cooling consumption  In addition, Information Systems has adopted practices to efficiently manage cooling requirements within the Data Center  We have adopted the practice of isolating cold isles from hot isles  This enables us to redirect cooling to where it is needed, making cooling more efficient by eliminating the need to cool the entire room

The Emergency Road Service contractor fleet includes over 895 light service repair vehicles This program leads the industry by moving away from larger tow trucks and provides members immediate repair at the roadside after a breakdown One independent contractor has converted its entire truck fleet to CNG fuel and installed a fueling station, which may serve as a model for other contractors in the future
The AAA Missouri ERS Club-Owned Fleet (COF) has 86 active service vehicles providing road service Of the 86 vehicles, 48 (56%) are light service vehicles which operate much more efficiently than a light duty / medium duty diesel tow-type truck We also operate 1 of the Smart vehicles for special events and peak call volume periods We are currently building a light-duty Hybrid diesel tow vehicle in the St Louis, Missouri COF operations as a replacement for a standard diesel flat-bed tow truck The Missouri COF is actively pursuing the potential use of either CNG or propane in the light service vehicle application The Club has encouraged the Contract Stations to make similar modifications within their own fleets wherever possible in an attempt to both reduce their operating costs, and emissions The total number of light service vehicles operating in the Missouri territory is 321, combined between COF and Contracted Stations
At our Administrative Office, we replaced our medium duty delivery trucks that operate on diesel fuel with new hybrid technology diesel-electric trucks These vehicles travel to our branch locations throughout Southern California and now have greatly reduced emissions and over double the fuel economy of their predecessors
Our Facilities and Construction division sets sustainability standards for vendors and products An example would be our participation in programs such as ""Construction by Design"" In designing new construction or renovations, we use native plant material that is drought resistant, install energy efficient LED lights and use recycled material in carpeting Existing materials are then recycled by the vendors to reduce our impact on the environment and landfills
We work closely with vendors and utility companies to procure and utilize the most energy efficient (low emission) equipment possible and look for ways to reduce the actual consumption We have replaced equipment we believe to be the least efficient based on age and performance We have completed the process of replacing a number of the chillers at our large administrative facilities with more energy efficient equipment that will utilize energy based on the actual load required (variable speed drives)
We are monitoring our energy consumption with a third party vendor This allows us to focus our capital investments on replacing equipment that is inefficient based on performance to reduce costs and consumption
Information Systems has adopted hardware standards that reduce our need to implement physical equipment We continue to reduce our physical foot print by embracing newer server technology such as virtualization, which reduces our overall power consumption In addition, Information Systems has adopted practices to efficiently manage cooling requirements within the Data Center We're adopting the practice of isolating cold isles from hot isles This enables us to redirect cooling to where it is needed, making cooling more efficient by eliminating the need to cool the entire room"	1291	en	mild gibberish

"1% of Humanas total $46,138,000,000 operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 
Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $46,138,000,000 operating budget

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, the installation of high efficiency motors and variable frequency drives (VFDs) in our data centers have resulted in energy efficiency while also prolong the life of the systems, resulting in increased reliability through the life of the equipment

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In addition, we invested $663,000 in data center energy efficiency projects in 2015 that were projected to reduce energy costs by nearly $196,000 annually

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our associates as well as our members As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low Our alternate/backup locations for the medical centers located in Florida have been prioritized to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 
The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them
State Farm has designed a website Energy Management-State Farm to provide policyholders with energy-related educational tools, resources and solutions  
As noted in earlier responses the Drive Safe and SaveTM promotes green initiatives, in part, by incentivizing fewer miles driven through lower premiums  Additionally there are many efforts underway in many business areas to streamline the customer communication experience and provide our customers with preferred communication channels  using electronic/paperless delivery options, and/or integrated mailings for all written communications related to sales and services, including billing and payment options
Finally, a multi-disciplined committee has been formed to evaluate corporate citizenship and consumer education and protection

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon  This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices  Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above
In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors  These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 
These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes  These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification
Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming  Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean  These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk  This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures  
Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers  Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

For example, we always encourage our auto policyholders to use telematics, not only because it makes drivers safer, but also because it encourages drivers to be more fuel efficient (wasteful speeding and rapid starts/stops are recorded) We also advise our fleet clients of risk management best practices, such as selecting drivers based upon their driving histories, including but not limited to speeding and reckless driving (which wastes fuel and results in greater emissions)
Our insureds understand that more miles driven and unnecessary personal use of company vehicles by employees increases their exposure to risk and usually their premium as well Insureds may be advised that reducing unnecessary miles driven and personal use of company vehicles by employees can reduce their premiums and also have a positive impact on climate change by reducing fuel usage and emissions
During our property surveys we always look at the age and condition of HVAC systems, electrical services, etc When these systems exceed 20 years of age, they are more likely to produce property claims from fires, etc When we identify these conditions, it is our standard practice to recommend that the client replace or upgrade their systems with units meeting current codes and standards Although we dont specifically ask insureds to replace old inefficient systems for efficiency purposes, our practices does have the effect of encouraging insureds to replace older systems with newer ones (which are also more efficient in virtually all cases) The use of LED lighting in warehouses is another example where ProSight and other insurers encourage clients to replace older, (inefficient & dangerous) metal halide lighting with newer systems that save tremendous amounts of energy (and are safer)  Additionally, loss control surveys also include assessment of risk exposures including vulnerability to flooding, power outages, brush fires, etc If we find situations which warrant improvement, we make recommendations to client to help them reduce chances of loss This has the side benefit of helping them deal more effectively with the impacts of climate change on their local environment

	Storm Shutters Discount

	Green Updates Endorsement
	Wind Mitigation Discount

ACIAs Fortified Homes Discount is available when the dwelling is certified as Fortified for Safer Living by the Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)

ACIA is also a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), an organization focused on reducing weather related losses through research, education and preventative measures

The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change 

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)  

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change: 


	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green 

	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events 

	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building 

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS 

In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

" The Auto Club and the Exchange are affiliates, with management services for the Exchanges insurance operations provided by subsidiaries or affiliates of the Auto Club The responses included in this survey incorporate activities of both the Exchange and the Auto Club, who may also be referred to as the Company, we or us, unless otherwise indicated

The Company has implemented a variety of initiatives and policies designed to help control costs and reduce the environmental impact of our operations These initiatives include the use of Rideshare plans, fleet emission management, and environmental considerations in the selection of vendors and suppliers

We file Rideshare Plans for each office with over 250 employees in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties In many instances, the Auto Club and the Exchange share facilities, allowing these plans to cover both entities Annually, these plans are submitted to, reviewed and approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District The plans provide strategy, implementation and results of achieving average vehicle ridership goals for employees commuting into those large offices on a regular basis Some specific segments of the plan include financial and non-financial incentives for those who carpool, vanpool, use public transportation, bicycle, or walk to work in lieu of driving a vehicle as a single passenger In 2018, the Auto Club provided financial incentives for those who drove electric vehicles and utilizes more efficient process for the employees The objective of these plans is to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads during the prime morning commutes and thus reduce emissions and greenhouse gases 

In a separate but related matter, we have a fleet of approximately 550 company vehicles in California, 408 of which we use for our Insurance Operations We have progressively operated more fuel efficient and lower emission vehicles in this fleet Each year we review a plan including what vehicles we need to continue to operate and/or will be acquiring as older vehicles need replacement The vehicles have migrated from Low Emission to Ultra Low Emission to Super Ultra Low Emission to Partial Zero Emission and even Zero Emissions over recent years The objective is to lower costs, use less fossil fuel and reduce emissions and greenhouse gases emitted from these vehicles In our California operations, we have a total of 247 Ford CMax hybrids, 95 Ford Fusion hybrids and 3 Freightliner diesel hybrid large trucks Additionally, the Auto Club has 7 Smart Fortwo 100% electric vehicles These vehicles are being used in our fleet for Insurance Claims adjusters, Special Events and Procurement 

To service the fleet as well as other electric vehicles the Auto Club has installed a total of four, dual port, fixed EV charging stations One of the charging stations is located at our headquarters in Los Angeles at the corner of Adams and Figueroa, and another at our Costa Mesa Branch Office These stations are available for public use The other two charging stations are installed at our Administrative Office for fleet and employee use only The use of these electric charging stations is free encouraging our employees to personally drive plugin hybrids or 100% electric vehicles to and from work Since the installation of these stations, we have seen a rapid rise in employees driving electrified vehicles to work thus reducing emissions We are working with Southern California Edison to install two additional, dual port, fixed EV charging stations, at our Los Cerritos and Upland branches These will be DC Fast Charge stations and will be available for public use

The Auto Club Driving School (CA) has replaced 52 of the 61 gas-powered instructional vehicles with hybrids since 2015 The remaining 9 gas-powered instructional vehicles will be replaced in 2019 with Ford Fusion Hybrids that have arrived as of August 20th, 2019 We will be expanding the driving school into Texas Q4 2019 and have 1 Ford Fusion there ready to go Moving forward, all vehicles ordered for the organization, including the driving school and future ACE market expansion, will be Ford Fusion Hybrids The Ford Fusion Hybrids are used for teen-driver training throughout Southern California, reduce emissions, and improve gas mileage from 24 mpg to 44 mpg

The AAA Missouri ERS Club-Owned Fleet (COF) has 164 active service vehicles providing road service Of the 164 vehicles, 84 (52%) are light service vehicles which operate much more efficiently than a light duty / medium duty diesel tow-type truck We also operate one of the Smart vehicles for special events and peak call volume periods We currently have in operation a light-duty Hybrid diesel tow vehicle in the New Orleans COF operations as a replacement for a standard diesel flat-bed tow truck The Missouri COF is actively pursuing the potential use of either CNG or propane in the light service vehicle application The Club has encouraged the Contract Stations to make similar modifications within their own fleets wherever possible in attempt to reduce both their operating costs and emissions The total number of light service vehicles operating in the AAA Missouri territory is 441, combined between COF and Contracted Stations

The Company has implemented a variety of initiatives and policies designed to help control costs and reduce the environmental impact of our operations These initiatives include the use of Rideshare plans, fleet emission management, and environmental considerations in the selection of vendors and suppliers
We file Rideshare Plans for each office with over 250 employees in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties In many instances, the Auto Club and the Exchange share facilities, allowing these plans to cover both entities Annually, these plans are submitted to, reviewed and approved by the South Coast Air Quality Management District The plans provide strategy, implementation and results of achieving average vehicle ridership goals for employees commuting into those large offices on a regular basis Some specific segments of the plan include financial and non-financial incentives for those who carpool, vanpool, use public transportation, bicycle, or walk to work in lieu of driving a vehicle as a single passenger In 2018, the Auto Club provided financial incentives for those who drove electric vehicles and utilizes more efficient process for the employees The objective of these plans is to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads during the prime morning commutes and thus reduce emissions and greenhouse gases
In a separate but related matter, we have a fleet of approximately 550 company vehicles in California, 408 of which we use for our Insurance Operations We have progressively operated more fuel efficient and lower emission vehicles in this fleet Each year we review a plan including what vehicles we need to continue to operate and/or will be acquiring as older vehicles need replacement The vehicles have migrated from Low Emission to Ultra Low Emission to Super Ultra Low Emission to Partial Zero Emission and even Zero Emissions over recent years The objective is to lower costs, use less fossil fuel and reduce emissions and greenhouse gases emitted from these vehicles In our California operations, we have a total of 247 Ford CMax hybrids, 95 Ford Fusion hybrids and 3 Freightliner diesel hybrid large trucks Additionally, the Auto Club has 7 Smart Fortwo 100% electric vehicles These vehicles are being used in our fleet for Insurance Claims adjusters, Special Events and Procurement
To service the fleet as well as other electric vehicles the Auto Club has installed a total of four, dual port, fixed EV charging stations One of the charging stations is located at our headquarters in Los Angeles at the corner of Adams and Figueroa, and another at our Costa Mesa Branch Office These stations are available for public use The other two charging stations are installed at our Administrative Office for fleet and employee use only The use of these electric charging stations is free encouraging our employees to personally drive plugin hybrids or 100% electric vehicles to and from work Since the installation of these stations, we have seen a rapid rise in employees driving electrified vehicles to work thus reducing emissions We are working with Southern California Edison to install two additional, dual port, fixed EV charging stations, at our Los Cerritos and Upland branches These will be DC ""Fast Charge"" stations and will be available for public use
The Auto Club Driving School (CA) has replaced 52 of the 61 gas-powered instructional vehicles with hybrids since 2015 The remaining 9 gas-powered instructional vehicles will be replaced in 2019 with Ford Fusion Hybrids that have arrived as of August 20th, 2019 We will be expanding the driving school into Texas Q4 2019 and have 1 Ford Fusion there ready to go Moving forward, all vehicles ordered for the organization, including the driving school and future ACE market expansion, will be Ford Fusion Hybrids The Ford Fusion Hybrids are used for teen-driver training throughout Southern California, reduce emissions, and improve gas mileage from 24 mpg to 44 mpg
The AAA Missouri ERS Club-Owned Fleet (COF) has 164 active service vehicles providing road service Of the 164 vehicles, 84 (52%) are light service vehicles which operate much more efficiently than a light duty / medium duty diesel tow-type truck We also operate one of the Smart vehicles for special events and peak call volume periods We currently have in operation a light-duty Hybrid diesel tow vehicle in the New Orleans COF operations as a replacement for a standard diesel flat-bed tow truck The Missouri COF is actively pursuing the potential use of either CNG or propane in the light service vehicle application The Club has encouraged the Contract Stations to make similar modifications within their own fleets wherever possible in attempt to reduce both their operating costs and emissions The total number of light service vehicles operating in the AAA Missouri territory is 441, combined between COF and Contracted Stations

Munich Re Group is one of the initiators of the Dii Initiative, aimed at establishing an energy infrastruc-ture in the EUMENA region supplying the Middle East/North Africa/Europe with renewable energy (RE) The initiative was established 2009 for three years Diis shareholders, including Munich Re, agreed in 2012 that Dii will be extended for two years until the end of 2014 As of August 2013, more than 30 people work at the Dii head office in Munich (Germany) and in its branches in Rabat (Moroc-co), Tunis (Tunisia) and Berlin (Germany) As shareholder Munich Re is member of the Dii Steering Operating Committee and participates in several working groups In addition MR supports different events, one example: Dr Torsten Jeworrek, Member of Munich Re Board, supported the annual meet-ing in Berlin in November 2012 with a key note speech highlighting the urgent need for new social and economic partnerships between Europe and its neighbors and the opportunities in the energy market The main goals of the Dii GmbH are:
1 Improving the electricity supply from renewables in MENA countries,
2 Developing a connected EU-MENA electricity market based on renewable energy technolo-gies; consequently, a supply of Europe with 10-20% of electricity from RE from the deserts in MENA by 2050 is expected based on Dii studies (see below)
The basic objectives are the creation of a positive investment climate (development of the technologi-cal, economic, political and regulatory framework), the initiation of selected reference projects, and the development of a long-term implementation concept by the year 2050 In June 2012 Desert Power 2050 was published focusing on mutual benefits for Europe and MENA from renewable energy de-ployment in the MENA region, demonstrating that a power system based on more than 90% of renew-able energy is technically possible and economically viable The second part of this publication, Get-ting Started, has been launched at a high-level Policy Conference of the EU Sustainable Energy Week organized by Dii in June 2013 The study provides the pathway towards an interconnected en-ergy system This implementation roadmap is crucial as it provides policy recommendations and fi-nancial/business case approaches for developing the renewable energy market in the MENA region in the coming decades
Adaptation Resiliency:
Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII) was initiated by Munich Re Group in April 2005, bringing together representatives from insurance, the World Bank, NGOs and science in response to the grow-ing realization that insurance solutions plays a role in adaptation to climate change The initiative is based at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) MCII has been involved in the United Nations climate negotiations process since 2005 and many of the main concepts have been included in post-Kyoto-Protocol negotiation texts and carried forward in-to the Work Programme on Loss and Damage under the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) of the UNFCCC Concrete examples of adaptation resiliency: Since 2011, MCII has been conducting the Climate Risk Adaptation and Insurance in the Caribbean project Initial funding has been provided by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) under the International Climate Initiative The project seeks to increase social resilience against ex-treme weather events by developing and implementing insurance solutions in three Caribbean coun-tries Since then two parametric weather-index based insurance solutions have been developed One product (Livelihood Protection Policy) is aimed at improving the financial protection of individuals in case of extreme weather events In May 2013 the Livelihood Protection Policy has been launched in St Lucia The insurance is designed in such a way as to offer incentives for reducing risks At the same time, the premium is so low that it is affordable for poor people The payment of benefits is triggered directly whenever a previously specified amount of rainfall or a wind-speed threshold is exceed-ed The other weather-index based insurance solutions targets lending institutions and provides a hedge against increased loan default after extreme weather events (Loan Portfolio Cover) This pro-ject is a first operative step of MCII in promoting integral risk management solutions for climate change adaptation in developing countries
Munich Reinsurance America, American Modern and HSB are members of the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) an organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance in-dustry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is avail-able directly to the public and to its members/policyholders
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
¿ As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and proper-ties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
¿ IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce fu-ture losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research con-ducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
¿ Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhance-ments do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong
As a building science institute, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand struc-tural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the dis-count programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in dis-aster-prone areas In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the resid-ual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments"	6	"g: Renewable Energy Generation and Adaptation Resiliency

In a Summary for Policymakers in 2014, the IPCC concluded, with a high degree of confidence, that two of the most effective [climate change] vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are programs thatsecure essential health care including vaccination and child health servicesand alleviate poverty KP is proud to have delivered care and coverage to 11 million more Americans in 2017 than in 2016 KP also extended Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program to more than 960,000 people, and provided our own charitable health coverage and medical financial assistance programs to nearly 270,000 people, subsidized by our more than $23 billion investment, in 2017

With regard to computer modeling, KP uses customized tools to conduct community health needs assessments in our communities These tools, which are freely available to the public at wwwchnaorg/kp, provide the capacity to view, map and analyze environmental conditions and health outcomes in a particular community, and provide information that can be applied to help any community KP used these tools in 2016 to guide it in conducting and publishing 37 Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) across all of the communities it serves These assessments are helping KP to identify, prioritize and address community health needs including poor health outcomes that are correlated with climate change For example, in KPs Colorado business unit, the units 2016 implementation strategy for addressing community health needs rated climate change as a medium priority health need and noted that: A changing climate poses long-term implications for health today and for future generations Poor air quality exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular conditions KP Colorado has opportunities to minimize the environmental impact of its facilities through internal programs and to encourage climate friendly transportation through grant-making (Source: wwwkpchnaorg/chna)

Another way that KP manages the risks of climate change is by limiting the carbon (and other environmental) footprint of its healthcare system Greater resource efficiency makes its buildings and operations more resilient to fluctuations in the availability and price of natural resources such as water and energy In 2017, KP reduced its operational GHG emissions by 29 percent compared to its 2008 baseline year KP achieved this reduction due to success in: 1 increasing energy efficiency (for example, several of Kaiser Permanentes buildings have received the US Environmental Protection Agencys Energy Star certification; and one of its California data centers was the first data center in the world to achieve LEED EBLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Existing BuildingsPlatinum certification); and 2 voluntarily purchasing enough green power, including both onsite and offsite renewable energy sources, to cover nearly one-third of its electricity needs in 2017
Since 2013, KP has required Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification for all of its new construction of hospitals, large medical offices and other major projects As of July 2018, 26 of KPs buildings have been LEED-certified With plans to spend roughly $30 billion on hospital and medical office construction between 2013 and 2022, KPs LEED Gold commitment is expected to contribute to a healthier environment by improving the environmental performance of 11 million square feet of real estate, or more than 100 buildings In 2017, KPs pursuit of LEED certifications helped to attract subscriptions by capital market participants to $1 billion in green bonds issued by KP to finance and refinance KPs construction of LEED-certified medical facilities
KPs climate adaptation actions include conducting an inventory of its hospitals using 500-year flood levels to assess vulnerability of its critical systems (eg, power, water) KP is developing plans to protect those systems

At Assurant, we believe that with the right approach, we can provide insurance for consumers currently in homes susceptible to extreme weather while maintaining sound actuarial standards Through our lender-placed insurance products, which also serve to protect lenders, consumers are provided the opportunity to secure coverage when other options may not be available Assurant is prepared and committed for the long term to remaining in Florida, for example, as well as other catastrophe-prone areas we service We take a long-term approach that is responsible to consumers, investors and society 

While we provide coverage for homeowners who lose coverage because of climate risk, we do not underwrite private flood policies in repetitive loss zones, as we believe it is important to follow responsible building practices We also educate consumers and regulators about the benefits of adopting climate-resilient improvements when constructing or repairing homes To incentivize these behaviors, where possible we offer discounts for those who have fortified their homes to mitigate the impacts of floods, hurricanes or other severe weather Most of our international home policies offer discounts for customers who build with more resilient materials and install wind mitigation features 

As one of the largest carriers of flood protection in the United States, we offer our customers a full suite of flood protection, including through the National Flood Insurance Program, which is reinsured, and through voluntary flood protection products that we underwrite To responsibly manage this risk, we employ flood specialistssuch as meteorologists, hydrologists and catastrophe modelersand leverage decades of experience to understand the intricacies of flood risk These underwriting practices and research investments support our long-term commitment to consumers who may be impacted by floods 
We continue to innovate new products to better serve our flood customers in the United States For example, we introduced our patent-pending flood coverage add-on, FlexCash, after observing that many consumers struggle with unexpected expenses before a claim payout arrives FlexCash provides an immediate fixed payout up to $10,000 after a flood event is verified using photographs This payment can help ease cash flow constraints that arise while we process a claim In 2017, nearly 70 percent of our voluntary flood polices include FlexCash In 2018, we also began offering limited flood coverage for renters Through the Federal Emergency Management Agencys Community Ratings System, we can discount flood insurance rates if the customer lives in a community that is taking action to mitigate long-term risks 

We also offer index-based insurance in certain geographies susceptible to climate change to protect consumers who are indirectly affected by extreme weather events Index-based insurance provides coverage to businesses that are indirectly impacted by climate change, such as a business owner whose surrounding neighborhood is damaged due to a natural disaster 

To help determine the protection solutions that best support our customers, consumers and the communities in which we operate, we engage with policy makers, government agencies and insurance regulators We work with regulators and state insurance departments to advocate for fair legislation that benefits our clients and end-consumers needs Through this dialogue, we develop new or improved products aligned with public policy interests

" As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Caledonia, MI, has replaced existing HID parking lot and road lights with more energy efficient LED lighting, and reduced the number of light heads on poles These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) There will be continued energy savings with projected carbon savings over the next 10 years of 2,145 tonnes CO2 In 2015 we have installed the same energy efficient lighting in Lake Mary, FL, which will result in continued energy reduction saving in Kilowatt usage per year 59,900 kWh/yr In 2014 we replaced all of the parking lot lighting in our LEED certified Oklahoma City, OK facility with LED Net energy savings is 133,634 kilowatts/yr We also replaced the Lobby lighting, workstation lighting, and display case lighting with LED We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions) In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts We will continue to look for additional opportunities, where available In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle Since 2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced Gallons of fuel and tons of CO2 emitted in 2016 were 41% lower than 2015  A 55% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this six year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces Farmers has also installed five electric charging stations at two facilities in California to provide an energy source for those employees who already drive electric vehicles and to also encourage more environmentally friendly vehicle use

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray We have also transitioned to zero scape in some locations

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color Farmers has implemented an MDS optimization program within Document Logistics, replacing multi-functional devises with more energy efficient equipment This program was put into place not only to reduce energy consumption and the impact on the environment, but to also ensure cost savings We are in the third year of the program and continue to reduce both the number and size of the multifunction devices (MFD) in our facilities Through YE 2016 we have reduced the number of multifunction devices (MFD) from 3,329 to 1,401 (58% reduction) Replacement machines are right sized and more energy efficient The overall result is a 2,068,445 lb (73%) reduction in CO2 emissions and a 1,313,100 kWh (71%) reduction in electricity usage over the 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping

We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online
Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project 1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level 7) In 2016 our large facility in Washington started a composting program as part of its waste services in the café and all kitchenettes

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail; On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%

" Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

"  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501©(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses, and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss  IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdiastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube and Vimeo)

IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:

As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fre and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green

IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change eve nts  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events

Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that Green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders  for example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong
As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building

A few states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas

The quickest way for individual property owners to find out if their residential or commercial building qualifies for an incentive (for example, by meeting the designation requirements of the FORTIFIED program) is to ask their insurance department or company  In addition to discounts, insurance incentives related to mitigation may include a positive decision by an underwriter to provide coverage in the voluntary, rather than through the residual, market, lower deductibles, or more favorable coverage terms relating to post-disaster claims payments  Again, these are business decisions made by individual insurers, and IBHS neither influences such decisions nor specifically tracks them

"  Aegon measures and publicly reports its CO2 emissions every year in it is integrated report, http://wwwcorporatereportingaegoncom/2013/review/value-chain/society/our-environmental-performance  In 2011, Aegon Group set a target to reduce our CO2 emissions by 10% in 2012, with 2009 as our base year  The scope of the target was office buildings in the three main country units: the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom where Aegon was the owner or a significant tenant and could control the long-term energy use  In 2012, Aegon achieved a reduction of almost 25% in CO2 emissions, well above the target of 10%  While Aegon has not set a new global target, it continues to closely monitor CO2 emissions from the use of gas and electricity as well as the scope 3 emissions from business travel 

In some of the country units local targets are set  For example, Aegon UK has been working on an intensity target to maintain per capita use of gas and electricity consumption in 2014 at levels which do not exceed 2013  Aegon UK additionally set a target to reduce emissions on short haul flights in 2014 compared to 2013  The UK operations represent between 10% to 15% of Aegons emissions from gas and electricity use and approximately 30% of its short haul air travel 

In 2014 Aegon will further mitigate CO2 emissions by switching to green electricity in the Netherlands  Aegon has been using green electricity in the UK since 2012 

During 2013, Aegon continued to work on a number of local initiatives to further reduce consumption of energy and other raw materials  These initiatives included:


                                                                  
Energy efficiency Building services: In the data center in Cedar Rapids, IA, Aegon replaced a 20 ton computer room air conditioning unit with a 35 ton unit that used approximately 53% of the energy used by the old unit The new unit uses a relatively new pumped refrigerant package that works on free cooling at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit It is estimated that the unit will use 45% less energy than similar cooled air units and 15% less than cooled water units
 
Energy efficiency Building Services:
Seven generators owned and operated by IEA at our properties were required to install diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) emissions reduction equipment per EPA RICE NESHAP guidelines  

Transportation fleet: At Aegon UK we have been focusing on the environmental impact of our lease cars as we replace our fleet During the course of 2013 we managed to bring down the average emissions down from 13875g/km to 11472g/km, a reduction of just over 17%

"	0	"Aegon measures and publicly reports its CO2 emissions every year in it is integrated report, http://wwwcorporatereportingaegoncom/2013/review/value-chain/society/our-environmental-performance In 2011, Aegon Group set a target to reduce our CO2 emissions by 10% in 2012, with 2009 as our base year The scope of the target was office buildings in the three main country units: the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom where Aegon was the owner or a significant tenant and could control the long-term energy use In 2012, Aegon achieved a reduction of almost 25% in CO2 emissions, well above the target of 10% While Aegon has not set a new global target, it continues to closely monitor CO2 emissions from the use of gas and electricity as well as the scope 3 emissions from business travel
In some of the country units local targets are set For example, Aegon UK has been working on an intensity target to maintain per capita use of gas and electricity consumption in 2014 at levels which do not exceed 2013 Aegon UK additionally set a target to reduce emissions on short haul flights in 2014 compared to 2013 The UK operations represent between 10% to 15% of Aegon's emissions from gas and electricity use and approximately 30% of its short haul air travel
In 2014 Aegon will further mitigate CO2 emissions by switching to ""green"" electricity in the Netherlands Aegon has been using ""green"" electricity in the UK since 2012
During 2013, Aegon continued to work on a number of local initiatives to further reduce consumption of energy and other raw materials These initiatives included:
Energy efficiency Building services: In the data center in Cedar Rapids, IA, Aegon replaced a 20 ton computer room air conditioning unit with a 35 ton unit that used approximately 53% of the energy used by the old unit The new unit uses a relatively new pumped refrigerant package that works on free cooling at temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit It is estimated that the unit will use 45% less energy than similar cooled air units and 15% less than cooled water units
Energy efficiency Building Services:
Seven generators owned and operated by IEA at our properties were required to install diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) emissions reduction equipment per EPA RICE NESHAP guidelines
Transportation fleet: At Aegon UK we have been focusing on the environmental impact of our lease cars as we replace our fleet During the course of 2013 we managed to bring down the average emissions down from 13875g/km to 11472g/km, a reduction of just over 17%

As stated in our core values, Columbia Insurance Group believes in being responsible corporate citizens In keeping with that statement, we are dedicated to the assessment, reduction, and mitigation of emissions in our operations where possible and appropriate  We continue to increase awareness and decrease emissions as an organization in the following ways:

	Our maintenance technician completed Building Operator Certification training through our local energy and utility provider, which resulted in a certification awarded by the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance  This program included a series of training courses and assigned projects regarding the energy and resource-efficient operation of buildings Our technician continues to implement the information learned through these courses where possible

	We continue to increase electronic policyholder communications where possible, and are working toward an entirely paperless option to decrease our use of paper, ink, and other materials

	We replaced all fluorescent light bulbs both inside and outside our buildings with energy-efficient LED lighting We project that over time, this will result in a 30% decrease in energy usage

	A majority of the HVAC units at our home office have been updated, which allows for more efficient operations and reduced emissions

	We decreased company travel by installing video conferencing equipment in all five branch office locations

	We expanded our recycling program to include aluminum, wooden skids, personal computers, plastic bottles, paper, and copy machines All discarded paper is shredded and shipped to a vendor to be pulped and repurposed into paper-based consumer products We also repurpose all office furniture or donate it to local non-profit companies instead of discarding it 

	We purchased our first hybrid fleet vehicle and transitioned over 85% of our remaining 64 fleet vehicles to four-cylinder engines to save on fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions

As part of the detailed risk assessment, Nationwides Enterprise Risk Management team works in collaboration with the business leaders across the multiple businesses to understand the risk that climate change poses over the strategic horizon  This process involves identifying exposure for incremental risk and reward as well as assessing the companys capabilities against industry practices  Risks associated with climate change as identified through Nationwides risk assessment process are discussed in the response to question four above
In order to measure the risks from certain natural perils potentially associated with climate change, Nationwide licenses the software and support of external catastrophe modeling vendors  These vendors constantly review and update their models to incorporate the most recent science available 
These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes  These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification
Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming  Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean  These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk  This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures  
Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers  Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program
Additional techniques utilized by Nationwide to manage catastrophe risks are discussed in the response to question six above

These models allow Nationwide to measure their catastrophe exposure and develop a perspective on the potential size and likelihood of various catastrophes These models also allow the Nationwide companies to assess how various strategies will impact this risk including changes to deductibles, changes to market shares and geographic diversification
Specific to the hurricane peril, the major catastrophe modeling vendors have developed alternative event scenario catalogs associated with increased sea surface temperatures which some scientists might attribute to global warming Elevated sea surface temperatures are important because hurricanes are fueled by the warmth of the ocean These alternative event catalogs, therefore, represent a climate-conditioned view of risk This alternate view is used to assess the sensitivity of insured risk to elevated sea surface temperatures
Beyond the direct output from the models, measurement and sensitivity analysis can be informed by maintaining external partnerships in academia, trade associations, experts from the modeling vendors, and reinsurers and brokers Nationwide has developed these types of external relationships and regularly avails itself of information from these sources as an integral part of the risk management program

Managing climate risk is a priority in much of the Companys commercial property and casualty (P&C) insurance underwriting practice The Company considers the factors behind climate change and its impact when evaluating new business lines and product offerings The P&C businesses seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal exposures that could be more directly affected by climate change Several of the Companys P&C products also include incentives for using environmentally sustainable construction materials to rebuild damaged property The Company provides services, training and educational information designed to help customers improve safety, remediate environmentally adverse events, reduce losses and operate more sustainably Whether is it limiting exposure to catastrophic risk, helping its insureds manage the risk of weathers uncertainty for their crops, or providing insureds coverage for cleaning up environmental contamination, the Company places management of environmental risk at the core of several of its key operations

The Companys investment policies do not include the consideration of the impact of climate change  However, investment decisions and risk management considerations guide the amount that may be invested in, or lent to, any one company or asset classification  The Company believes its investment policies, as reflected in its investment portfolio, provide sufficient diversification without specifically considering climate change

The companys risk management process identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on Chubbs overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of various risks ranges from the known, based on definitive historical loss experience, to the hypothetical, where we use a calculation called probable maximum loss (PML) that relies on modeling based on various assumptions Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world In addition, we use catastrophe modeling packages reliant upon meteorology and engineering assumptions to simulate and estimate hurricane losses 

In its 10-K filed each year with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Chubb discloses risks that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition, and identifies the occurrence of natural disasters as a key business risk The disclosure further notes that climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition Additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business The occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management and capital allocation purposes Chubb uses these models to aggregate and monitor its natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change For example, due to the fact that Earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a more short-term view of event frequency that proprietary catastrophe modeling tools address as part of their underwriting process, and we strictly regulate the concentration of those risks we are willing to underwrite 

Chubb also incorporates risk mitigation services through its risk management and site surveys; specification of terms and conditions in policies; and the development of sound underwriting guidelines into the underwriting of catastrophe-exposed products (eg, property, energy, marine or crop coverage) Chubbs modeling and underwriting approach allows for risk differentiation  and hence price differentiation  across our client base Clients that mitigate risk  through retrofitting buildings to comply with updated building codes, installation of hurricane shutters and relocating exposures away from coastlines and floodplains  will have lower insurance costs than those that do not Chubb also makes use of terms and conditions to ensure appropriate risk selection and potentially reward certain policyholder behavior 

The company is also actively engaged with regulators to ensure that pricing is actuarially sound and can be adapted to meet new and emerging climate change risks and the capital implications of these risks For Chubb to continue to offer coverage under climate change conditions, pricing must always be set at sound actuarial rates that cover loss costs, expenses and risk margins on exposed capital

A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, has been compiled annually since 2012 by Lincoln Financial Groups Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams responsible for operating and managing Lincolns facilities 
The Office of Corporate Responsibility has a well-established process for collecting and reporting data and information related to the companys environmental impacts, including climate change and GHG emissions Activities and related goals have included and continue to be focused on improvements to facilities to improve energy management and reduce GHG emissions, including occupancy optimization strategies, energy efficiency improvements to equipment, and conservation efforts For example, if the expected ROI for a newly proposed energy reduction project is within 12-18 months, the project will be funded from the current year's energy budget If the ROI period exceeds 18 months, projects are reviewed as part of the annual company-wide strategic planning process All decisions regarding the purchase of equipment, changes to building structures and or systems or processes are evaluated based on the financial cost and benefit to the organization For every project, various methods of accomplishing the goal will be evaluated  Energy efficiency is among the factors considered in the decision-making process
Upon undergoing a renovation in our facilities, Lincoln explores opportunities to integrate energy efficient technologies and compares this with the cost of standard technology For example, Lincoln has used energy efficient technologies, such as chillers and lighting equipment, in several of its locations, including Greensboro, Omaha and Fort Wayne Many of these are capital expenditure projects for which capital is allocated based on analysis of both first cost and cost savings over time, as well as reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
Our original goal for the Greensboro campus was to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by
2020 compared to a 2014 baseline We surpassed that goal in 2018  achieving more than a 17%
reduction  and set a new goal to achieve a total reduction of 35% by 2022 In 2020, we continued to
make progress on this goal and reduced electricity consumption by 34% during our year of working
from home This goal will be superseded by our new 2020 targets that are aligned with the Paris
Agreement (see below)

In our Omaha location, we sought to reduce consumption by 8% by 2020 based on a 2014 baseline
We surpassed this goal in 2019 with a total reduction of nearly 11% In 2020, we continued this trend
of lowering our electricity usage, reaching a total reduction of 32% since 2014

We had previously committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions intensity per employee from
purchased electricity (Scope 2) by 20% by 2020 against a 2014 baseline We exceeded this target
earlier than expected, reducing our overall intensity per employee by 2742% in 2019 For 2020, we
continued to decrease our intensity per employee by 45%

Setting new greenhouse gas reduction goals

Lincoln remains committed to reducing our environmental impact in line with evolving best practices
and scientific frameworks

Having successfully achieved the initial targets set in 2014, Lincoln Financial set a new GHG
reduction target in 2020: to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline by the
year 2025

This aligns with the science-based targets methodology for reducing direct emissions Our targets
are consistent with the international Paris Agreements goal to limit global temperatures from rising
more than 15 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels
"	0	"A comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory, inclusive of some aspects of Scope 3 emissions, has been compiled annually since 2012 by Lincoln Financial Group's Office of Corporate Responsibility and the various administrative services teams responsible for operating and managing Lincoln's facilities
The Office of Corporate Responsibility has a well-established process for collecting and reporting data and information related to the company's environmental impacts, including climate change and GHG emissions Activities and related goals have included and continue to be focused on improvements to facilities to improve energy management and reduce GHG emissions, including occupancy optimization strategies, energy efficiency improvements to equipment, and conservation efforts For example, if the expected ROI for a newly proposed energy reduction project is within 12-18 months, the project will be funded from the current year's energy budget If the ROI period exceeds 18 months, projects are reviewed as part of the annual company-wide strategic planning process All decisions regarding the purchase of equipment, changes to building structures and or systems or processes are evaluated based on the financial cost and benefit to the organization For every project, various methods of accomplishing the goal will be evaluated Energy efficiency is among the factors considered in the decision-making process
Upon undergoing a renovation in our facilities, Lincoln explores opportunities to integrate energy efficient technologies and compares this with the cost of standard technology For example, Lincoln has used energy efficient technologies, such as chillers and lighting equipment, in several of its locations, including Greensboro, Omaha and Fort Wayne Many of these are capital expenditure projects for which capital is allocated based on analysis of both first cost and cost savings over time, as well as reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions
Our original goal for the Greensboro campus was to reduce electricity consumption by 10% by
2020 compared to a 2014 baseline We surpassed that goal in 2018 - achieving more than a 17%
reduction - and set a new goal to achieve a total reduction of 35% by 2022 In 2020, we continued to
make progress on this goal and reduced electricity consumption by 34% during our year of working
from home This goal will be superseded by our new 2020 targets that are aligned with the Paris
Agreement (see below)

"  As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

We have initiatives in process that reduce our carbon footprint  These include changes in the way we manage our facilities, our fleet, and our travel 

Our goal is to purchase energy in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner, and to establish and implement effective energy management programs

Our facility in Wilmington, DE has recently replaced all fluorescent fixtures with LED Fixtures These LED fixtures are typically 50% - 75% more energy efficient and have a useful life of 72,000 hours (82 years with 24/7 use) Projected savings over the next 10 years are $700,000 and 4,384 tons of CO2  We have previously installed a new Cool Roof product at one of our facilities and have installed solar panels in two other locations  We continue to implement electrical power conservation programs in multiple operations  In some locations we have installed motion sensitive light switches and energy saving light bulbs (such as ALTO lights from Phillips, which are recognized by the industry as energy-efficient lighting solutions), and in 2014 our claims office in  Oklahoma City, OK has replaced 154 existing parking lot lighting fixtures with more energy efficient LED light fixtures  In Austin, TX we have converted our 190,000 sq ft office and also our 9,000 sq ft office in McAllen, TX over to 100% green electricity through electricity provider contracts  In Grand Rapids, MI we have replaced (4) 25+ year old elevators with more energy efficient elevators which are projected to save $5,000 annually in electricity costs  In addition to these improvements, we have also implemented programs to remind employees to power down equipment when it is not in use  Many computer monitors and desktop computers are automatically set to go into a sleep or hibernation mode after a short period of inactivity

Depending on job assignment, employees may be provided with a company fleet vehicle  Since  2010, more fuel efficient, 4 cylinder vehicles have been selected for our general lines vehicles and the number of unassigned and pool vehicles at our various office locations has been reduced  Miles driven in 2014 were 33%lower than miles driven in 2010  A 44% reduction in the total tons of CO2 over this five year time period has been attained due to fewer vehicles in service, fewer miles driven and the decision to down-size from full-size to mid-size and compact vehicles 

As many Farmers employees commute to our business locations, we encourage ridesharing and the use of public transportation  In some locations, we provide incentives including subsidies for train passes, bus passes and vanpools, free shuttle buses from train stations, and preferred carpool parking spaces  

Telepresence technology and high quality HD video conferencing systems in many operations have helped minimize airline travel   

In addition to our focus on the reduction of emissions we have made improvements in our effort to reduce water consumption  Improvements include low volume sink faucets, low volume toilets, and waterless urinals  Other improvements within our operations include upgrades to programmable irrigation systems and pop-up sprinkler heads, which eliminate leakage and overspray

We continue to work on reducing utilization of paper and office supplies   Copier/printer machines in many of our locations are set for duplex (two-sided) printing and the print/copy default has been set to black and white vs color  We have completed the first year of a 3 year project to reduce the number of multifunctional devices (MDF) within our office buildings from 3,269 to 1,522 machines (53% reduction) and replace the remaining 47% with more energy efficient equipment; projecting an energy cost savings of $195,098, 1,300,653 KWh and 895 tons of CO2 over a 3 year period

Virtually all employee communications are handled electronically rather than through paper  As of 2011, semi-monthly statements of employee earnings and deductions have been electronically available and are no longer printed and mailed to employees  Improved ordering processes have lowered the volume of consumable supplies in many locations  Recycling programs have been implemented for paper, plastic, cardboard and glass  Printer, copier ink and toner cartridges are also recycled, as are cell phones, chargers and obsolete electronic equipment such as computers and monitors  In our mail rooms, we have begun recycling and reusing packing materials for shipping
We have implemented initiatives that provide customers with environmentally friendly choices that also reduce the organizations carbon footprint For example, in some operations, mail sent to agents and customers is delivered in envelopes made of recycled material  A new billing system available in some states and for some products provides increased on-line billing and payment capabilities  In some states and for some products, we are working to provide customers with the option to receive electronic policy forms and notices from us, rather than paper copies  Customers with these electronic policies may also have the option to receive bills, pay bills, and view their billing histories online  Some states prohibit the use of paperless communication with policyholders, which limits our ability to consider paperless options 

Our MultiCar auto policy, available in some states, can cover multiple vehicles on one policy, thereby reducing the amount of paper customers receive and our overall carbon footprint

In 2010, Farmers built a 164,000 SF facility in Oklahoma City that was recognized by the US Green Building Council as qualifying for Core and Shell LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification at the silver level, and also qualified for LEED certification for the Tenant Improvement portion of the project  1400 employees moved into the building in October 2010 and continue to work there today  

In some of our larger facilities: 1) ice and water machines are provided, reducing plastic bottled water consumption; 2) programmable thermostats are in place; 3) carbon footprint studies and energy audits have been completed; 4) Energy Star equipment is purchased whenever practical; 5) cleaning hours were revised to allow for more daytime cleaning, allowing us to deactivate interior lights earlier in the evening; 6) new employees are informed of our green business practices during their initial training classes and existing employees receive regular electronic communications on various energy-related topics, keeping awareness at a high level

In addition the two Print and Distribution Centers in North America have implemented several significant initiatives to mitigate impacts to the environment including: aggressive approach to deliver agent, customer and broker documents electronically versus traditional USPS mail;  On-line report viewing; purchasing of envelopes and stationary manufactured with paper from trees harvested from forests that are SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified, Print-On-Demand of agent support materials versus warehoused stored materials; digitizing as much in-bound mail as possible via an active imaging approach; implemented many initiatives improving efficiency, lowering energy consumption, actively participating in operational recycling program, consolidating operations to a  two-site COE model and reducing operational waste from 4% to less than 2%"	0	"As an organization, Farmers recognizes that it is essential that we consider the impact we have on the environment, and that we create and foster a culture where all individuals are aware of opportunities to conserve energy and natural resources

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the Companies write primarily commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
	Hurricane and tropical storm
	Tornado
	Flood
	Drought
	Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine  The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes  Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall  For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events  In the long term the current consensus view is that there will be fewer hurricanes, but that these will be of greater intensity However the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see the these changes

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on these nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornados is not increasing  In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornados reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source  

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP  
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood  In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits

Drought & Wildfire
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected  One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past  Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America

The Group does not write the two business lines that would be most significantly impacted by drought (crop multi-peril) or by wildfire (homeowners)  Consequently our losses arising from such events are minimal

" However, Cambia does have a formal sustainability program that seeks to incorporate the triple bottom line framework (economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social equity) into its planning, decision-making, and operations The sustainability program includes efforts to incorporate greater environmental stewardship into company operations Working with Cambias Real Estate and Facilities department, Information Technology (IT), and Human Resources, Cambia has undertaken the following efforts that will result in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions:

	Information Technology (IT): There are several efforts within Cambias IT infrastructure where technology and date center infrastructure changes have resulted in efficiencies directed at power, cooling, and space:
o	Major cooling upgrade to Salt Lake City data center
o	Switch to more efficient servers
o	Server virtualization
o	Mainframe consolidation
o	Increased data storage efficiencies
o	Replace firewall infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Replaced load balancer infrastructure with a more energy-efficient system
o	Upgraded our call center telephone system
o	Recycle eWaste though a BAN-certified eCyclerShift to print on demand and double-sided paper
	Real Estate and Facilities:
o	Replaced aging HVAC system (boilers and chillers) with more energy efficient system
o	Established standardized HVAC temperature set points, to maximize unit efficiencies, which reduced energy consumption
o	Implemented daylight harvesting in Burlington, and implementing in locations when remodels occur
o	Changed lighting in Salem garage from sodium vapor to fluorescent
o	Received Energy Star certification in 2 locations (Burlington and Tacoma), tracking energy use in all locations through Energy Star
o	Contracting with a janitorial vendor that uses proprietary green cleaners and microfiber towels
o	Renovating and maintaining our office space through use of low VOC paints and carpets, purchasing products with recycled content, reusing materials and furniture where possible, recycling materials such as carpet
o	Conducting waste audits to assess the waste stream and identify opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling 
	Human Resources
o	Reducing our actual footprint through telework and mobile work arrangements An estimated 27% of Cambia employees now work remotely This initiative has reduced/eliminated commutes for these employees with a commensurate reduction in emissions (We have not measured the reduced emissions or other environmental benefits of this shift to remote and mobile work) While we expect this effort to have decreased emissions, we recognized that there is some displacement of emissions to employees who are now lighting, heating, and cooling their homes during the day when they are working from home
o	Cambia has a strong commute reimbursement program that subsidizes public transit passes and carpooling

" However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources  Since 2006, ACE has reduced overall GHG emissions 22% per employee  In 2007 ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006-2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide Greenhouse Gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 In 2014, ACE reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 47% per employee since 2012 The corporate GHG inventory program still actively uses the EPA Climate Leaders methodology While that program was discontinued in late 2011, it is based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis

To achieve our GHG reduction goal, ACE will aggressively work to make reductions within the organization The majority of ACEs emissions  approximately 70%  result from electricity use (data centers, plug loads, lighting, etc) and stationary combustion (oil/natural gas) by our offices As a result, ACEs Corporate Environmental Program focuses primarily on reducing our energy consumption at the facility level  specifically, in our owned buildings and larger, long-term leased spaces In 2014, ACE voluntarily implemented several building efficiency projects at our owned facilities including installation of new HVAC equipment, LED lighting as well as Building Automation System (BAS) upgrades and installation Due to green building efforts, ACEs Philadelphia building has reduced energy consumption more than 20% since 2006 through the installation of new boilers, LED lighting, efficient ventilation equipment and variable speed drive HVAC equipment The building earned LEED Silver certification through the US Green Building Council in August 2009 and in November 2014 achieved Gold certification In July 2011, ACEs Bermuda office earned LEED Gold certification due in large part to re-lamping of office lights, applying a floating temperature set point and installing motion sensors and timers on office equipment These actions reduced electrical needs by approximately 500,000 kilowatt-hours (358 metric tons of CO2e) per year ACE furthered its commitment to reducing emissions by earning Energy Star designations for both the Wilmington, Del, and the Philadelphia, Pa, offices in 2015

In 2014, ACE created a targeted energy policy for its operations in Europe, a region that includes 19 countries The policy aims to reduce GHG emissions by establishing building energy benchmarking and pursuing short-term objectives that reduce energy consumption within the region As part of this policy, ACE has conducted an energy audit at the London, UK office, for example, and has identified GHG reduction opportunities that are currently being implemented 

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person square footage, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption ACE also manages its flight-related emissions by operating new, ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow ACEs aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, ACE reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world In 2014, ACEs 2013 submission to the CDP resulted in a disclosure score of 93 and a performance score of B

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person square footage, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption ACE also manages its flight-related emissions by operating new, ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow ACE's aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, ACE reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world In 2014, ACE's 2013 submission to the CDP resulted in a disclosure score of 93 and a performance score of B"	865	en	mild gibberish

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $46,138,000,000 operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $46,138,000,000 operating budget

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, the installation of high efficiency motors and variable frequency drives (VFDs) in our data centers have resulted in energy efficiency while also prolong the life of the systems, resulting in increased reliability through the life of the equipment

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In addition, we invested $663,000 in data center energy efficiency projects in 2015 that will reduce energy costs by nearly $196,000 annually
"	3	"The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humana's total $46,138,000,000 operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal
Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

" Climate change is contributing to higher sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels and an increasing trend in extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, winter storms, heat waves, wildfires and hurricane intensity These weather events are colliding with the realities of urbanization  the growing exposures from the concentration of people and values created by the longterm shift from rural to urban living, including suburban sprawl  and so many located near water and wilderness because thats where people want to live Add to that government social policies that insulate people and society from the true costs of their decisions Hurricanes Florence, Michael and Harvey were significant events causing record flooding in the US Meanwhile, 2018 was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California following 17s recordsetting wildfires Given the longterm threat and the shortterm nature of politics, the failure of policymakers to address climate change, including these issues and the costs of living in or near highrisk areas, is an existential threat As an underwriting company, our job is to understand, structure and assume climate changerelated risk for a fair price, and only do so to the extent of our balance sheet wherewithal and our ability to spread the risk to thirdparty capital Our approach to underwriting is factbased and relies on both our own experience and scientific expertise, and that of the expert network we engage outside our organization Climate risk is complex and requires a deep and evolving understanding of the physical processes causing weather extremes These tools are improving and are providing better insights to aid in how we think about these perils, but much remains unknown For example, what were traditionally nonmodeled risks can now be better analyzed, but flood models, for instance, are more advanced than those for wildfire, which remain relatively crude We also recognize that no matter how good, there is still much basis risk in our conclusions However, keep in mind that natural catastrophes are a shorttail risk, so losses are understood relatively quickly, and we can in most cases react to what we observe

Climate change is integrated into Chubbs strategies: the business (related financial risks and opportunities); operations (steps taken to reduce Chubbs GHG emission and ensure continuity of operations); and philanthropy (support of programs that further environmental stewardship)

The most important business strategy components influenced by climate change are changing hazards and opportunities Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Chubb has adjusted the pricing of some insurance lines, such as catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance, to reflect the high number and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years Because we are a global company, we consider all territories globally as potentially affected by climate risk

Our strategy has also been influenced indirectly, as Chubb provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may be more frequent or severe due to climate change Business lines that may be impacted include energy, marine, property and crop insurance coverage However, the same risks also present opportunities For example, Chubb has built on its environmental underwriting and product leadership due to commercial interest resulting from increased regulation of carbon emissions and the move to develop renewable and alternative energy projects around the world Further, by combining the product and risk management expertise of its Construction, Energy and Marine industry groups, Chubb addresses perils that occur in the construction and operation of a renewable energy project

Chubb has also gained business opportunities related to the regulatory aspects of climate change Chubbs risk appetite, expertise and financial strength enable the company to assume a leadership position in insuring the developing areas of regulated GHG emissions, enhancements to existing products or entirely new product lines required by the potential for increased regulation of greenhouse gases globally, as well as emerging related exposures, such as directors & officers and professional liability As regulation and awareness increase, these coverages are expected to grow in demand

Additionally, as part of its underwriting process, Chubb regularly applies exclusions, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated Those exclusions may reflect ESG-related considerations For example, Chubb is among the worlds largest global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risks However, Chubbs underwriting in this business restricts any participation in certain industries, including mining and reclamation operations, oil refining, pipeline and distribution operations and chemical manufacturing and distribution As another example, a company's ESG profile has a large effect on whether we will underwrite its Director's and Officers (D&O) insurance Since Chubb's exact underwriting criteria is proprietary and critical to its ability to compete effectively, we keep that underwriting criteria non-public and confidential

Chubbs strategy includes reducing GHG emissions from its own operations In 2014, Chubb announced a goal of reducing emissions by 10% per employee by 2020 from a 2012 baseline From 2012 to 2015, Chubbs GHG emissions per employee were reduced by 5% In 2016, ACE acquired The Chubb Corporation and adopted the Chubb name From 2015 to 2017, the combined Chubb organization reduced absolute global emissions by 11% In 2019, Chubb set a companywide goal to reduce our global greenhouse emissions by 20% on an absolute basis by 2025 and 40% by 2035 Both goals use 2016 emissions levels as the baseline Chubbs goals are aligned with the 2-degree Celsius target outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as the science-based standards methodology of the United Nations Environment Program

As a result of the culmination of years of energy-savings improvements, Chubbs office in Philadelphia earned LEED Silver certification in 2009 Over the next five years, Chubb increased energy efficient lighting (raising the Energy Star score from 72 to an 84), supported alternative commuting and implemented other green building initiatives at the location As a result, in 2014, the Philadelphia building earned LEED Gold recertification Our Bermuda office was re-certified LEED Gold in 2019

In the current reporting year, substantial business decisions influenced by climate change include Chubbs internal operations Initiatives to reduce workstation size and consolidate office space have resulted in a significant reduction in space per employee Chubb also invested in and implemented energy audits and efficiency improvements within our owned and long-term leased spaces Recent energy efficiency upgrades within three of our offices (in 2018, Whitehouse Station, NJ) enabled Chubb to reduce GHG emissions Further projects are underway

Chubbs philanthropy prioritizes environmental programs Through the Conservation Funds Chubb Land Legacy Fund, Chubb has provided over $1 million in funding since 2006 for the conservation of more than 345,000 acres of critical lands and water resources in the US The Chubb Charitable Foundation partnered with The Nature Conservatory to provide the continuation and expansion of coral reef restoration in the Mesoamerican Reef This effort resulted in transplanting 10,000 new coral colonies and establishing restoration sites The Foundation also funded a project with The Nature Conservancy  to conduct a restoration and resilience project in Florida to demonstrate the flood protection benefits of nature-based solutions For over 20 years, Chubb has supported the Bermuda National Trust with nearly $450,000 in grants to help preserve precious natural reserves and woodlands The Chubb Charitable Foundation also supports the environmental sustainability of cultural institutions Through a Foundation grant, the Philadelphia Museum of the American Revolution was recently awarded a LEED Gold certification for its commitment to energy conservation and environmental awareness Chubb additionally has an ongoing relationship with the American Forests Global ReLeaf®, wherein one tree is planted for each Environmental Insurance policy bound

Chubb provides customers, suppliers and investors with confidence in its commitment to address environmental and climate change risks and opportunities, while confirming its expertise in providing environmental and climate change solutions 
"	3	"Climate change is contributing to higher sea surface temperatures, rising sea levels and an increasing trend in extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, winter storms, heat waves, wildfires and hurricane intensity These weather events are colliding with the realities of urbanization -- the growing exposures from the concentration of people and values created by the long-term shift from rural to urban living, including suburban sprawl -- and so many located near water and wilderness because that's where people want to live Add to that government social policies that insulate people and society from the true costs of their decisions Hurricanes Florence, Michael and Harvey were significant events causing record flooding in the US Meanwhile, 2018 was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire season on record in California following '17's record-setting wildfires Given the long-term threat and the short-term nature of politics, the failure of policymakers to address climate change, including these issues and the costs of living in or near high-risk areas, is an existential threat As an underwriting company, our job is to understand, structure and assume climate change-related risk for a fair price, and only do so to the extent of our balance sheet wherewithal and our ability to spread the risk to third-party capital Our approach to underwriting is fact-based and relies on both our own experience and scientific expertise, and that of the expert network we engage outside our organization Climate risk is complex and requires a deep and evolving understanding of the physical processes causing weather extremes These tools are improving and are providing better insights to aid in how we think about these perils, but much remains unknown For example, what were traditionally non-modeled risks can now be better analyzed, but flood models, for instance, are more advanced than those for wildfire, which remain relatively crude We also recognize that no matter how good, there is still much basis risk in our conclusions However, keep in mind that natural catastrophes are a short-tail risk, so losses are understood relatively quickly, and we can in most cases react to what we observe""
Climate change is integrated into Chubb's strategies: the business (related financial risks and opportunities); operations (steps taken to reduce Chubb's GHG emission and ensure continuity of operations); and philanthropy (support of programs that further environmental stewardship)
The most important business strategy components influenced by climate change are changing hazards and opportunities Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated analytical, catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories We recognize that climate changes and weather patterns are integral to our underwriting process and we continually adjust our process to address these changes This approach is intended to help ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses and Chubb as a whole Chubb has adjusted the pricing of some insurance lines, such as catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance, to reflect the high number and severity of natural catastrophes in recent years Because we are a global company, we consider all territories globally as potentially affected by climate risk
Our strategy has also been influenced indirectly, as Chubb provides clients with insurance and reinsurance protection from the impact of natural catastrophes, including weather events that may be more frequent or severe due to climate change Business lines that may be impacted include energy, marine, property and crop insurance coverage However, the same risks also present opportunities For example, Chubb has built on its environmental underwriting and product leadership due to commercial interest resulting from increased regulation of carbon emissions and the move to develop renewable and alternative energy projects around the world Further, by combining the product and risk management expertise of its Construction, Energy and Marine industry groups, Chubb addresses perils that occur in the construction and operation of a renewable energy project
Chubb has also gained business opportunities related to the regulatory aspects of climate change Chubb's risk appetite, expertise and financial strength enable the company to assume a leadership position in insuring the developing areas of regulated GHG emissions, enhancements to existing products or entirely new product lines required by the potential for increased regulation of greenhouse gases globally, as well as emerging related exposures, such as directors & officers and professional liability As regulation and awareness increase, these coverages are expected to grow in demand
Additionally, as part of its underwriting process, Chubb regularly applies exclusions, which depend on the specific conditions and circumstances of the risk being evaluated Those exclusions may reflect ESG-related considerations For example, Chubb is among the world's largest global underwriters of environmental liabilities and pollution risks However, Chubb's underwriting in this business restricts any participation in certain industries, including mining and reclamation operations, oil refining, pipeline and distribution operations and chemical manufacturing and distribution As another example, a company's ESG profile has a large effect on whether we will underwrite its Director's and Officers (D&O) insurance Since Chubb's exact underwriting criteria is proprietary and critical to its ability to compete effectively, we keep that underwriting criteria non-public and confidential
Chubb's strategy includes reducing GHG emissions from its own operations In 2014, Chubb announced a goal of reducing emissions by 10% per employee by 2020 from a 2012 baseline From 2012 to 2015, Chubb's GHG emissions per employee were reduced by 5% In 2016, ACE acquired The Chubb Corporation and adopted the Chubb name From 2015 to 2017, the combined Chubb organization reduced absolute global emissions by 11% In 2019, Chubb set a companywide goal to reduce our global greenhouse emissions by 20% on an absolute basis by 2025 and 40% by 2035 Both goals use 2016 emissions levels as the baseline Chubb's goals are aligned with the 2-degree Celsius target outlined in the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as the science-based standards methodology of the United Nations Environment Program
As a result of the culmination of years of energy-savings improvements, Chubb's office in Philadelphia earned LEED Silver certification in 2009 Over the next five years, Chubb increased energy efficient lighting (raising the Energy Star score from 72 to an 84), supported alternative commuting and implemented other green building initiatives at the location As a result, in 2014, the Philadelphia building earned LEED Gold recertification Our Bermuda office was re-certified LEED Gold in 2019

" Below is an overview of Libertys energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards

LEED Building Certification 
	Liberty Mutual has 5 LEED certified buildings and one under recertification and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings
	To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms 
	As the Company builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints Liberty Mutuals new 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
	Liberty Mutual works in accordance to best practices established through USGBC related to water efficiency (eg low flow fixtures), materials and resources (USGBC approved products and sealants), energy (motion, LED lights), and indoor air quality Liberty Mutual also ensures that these areas also meet guidelines set by local municipalities and landlords 
	At the Companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston office parking lot 
	In 2017 and 2018, the Company diverted over 127 tons of furniture from waste disposal and donated $743k in furniture to local nonprofit organizations and schools 
	By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio 
	Liberty Mutual identifies opportunities to introduce its Aspirational Values throughout all Liberty Mutual offices through thoughtful design and consideration of the employee experience; elements include:
o	Access to Daylight: having fewer offices and conference rooms on the perimeter of facilities to allow employees to have access and work next to natural daylight
o	Circulation and Connectivity: active paths of travel that result in employee interaction; spaces designed for visual and physical connectivity to encourage interaction between employees; and central areas where employees can gather and eat healthy food options

Catering and Cafeteria 
	Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and implemented the same programs in its Plano, TX and other facilities in 2018 The programs are:
o	The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes In 2018, 169 tons of organic waste was produced and recycled The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer
o	The Bring Your Own Cup Program was implemented to reduce disposable cup usage and switched the disposable cups from foam to paper
o	Liberty Mutual has implemented the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the new Plano cafeteria; the Company continues to learn and where appropriate apply this policy to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations 
o	The Companys cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc

Paper, Printing, and Office Supplies
	The Companys Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2018 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,087 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 3,022,659 pounds of CO2 avoided, 35,027 trees saved, 57 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 10,437 cubic yards of landfill space conserved
	Through Print$mart, in 2018, employees conserved 18 million gallons of water, saved 20,934 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,482 tons, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 872 tons
	Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer content During 2018, these initiatives saved 400,000 gallons of water, 720 trees, and 83,066 pounds of CO2 Note: Liberty Mutuals partner vendor no longer calculates kWh saved 

Auto Program and Commuting 
	100% of Liberty Mutuals automotive fleet consists of either PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) or flex-fuel vehicles 
	In 2018, the Company reduced its fleet by 43%, reduced miles driven by 86%, increased MPG by 04%, and decreased gallons consumed by 87% The Company has continued to transition its fleet from six- to four-cylinder vehicles; as of year-end 2018, 88% of vehicles are four-cylinder, up from 62% at the end of 2017, resulting in a reduction of 1,6456 tons CO2 emissions 
	Liberty Mutual offers employees the ability to purchase pre-tax transit and monthly parking permits and encourages employee usage of commuting alternatives to driving alone 
	At office locations with the largest employee populations, Liberty Mutual has partnerships with local transit agencies and other stakeholders to tailor its employee commuter amenities to the commuting demographic of the area Some of these offerings include priority rideshare parking, electrical charging stations, commuter counseling, as well as lockers and showers for cyclists and those who commute by foot 
	Through these efforts, Liberty Mutual is aiding employees with their commutes and meeting the various state trip reduction regulations These regulations are state, county, or city specific and require businesses of certain sizes to achieve a defined reduction of single occupant commuting vehicles These efforts also help Liberty Mutual contribute to national standards regarding the reduction of carbon emissions

" The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (""ERRC"") is Allstate's senior risk management committee and includes the CEO, business unit presidents, enterprise and business unit chief risk officers and chief financial officers, general counsel, and treasurer The ERRC convenes monthly to assess and manage risks and opportunities, including topics
related to climate change, which may impact the company

Additionally, Allstate's Sustainability Leadership Committee, composed of officers and senior staff from across the company, meets on a quarterly basis in order to guide environmental efforts from an enterprise wide perspective, build alignment, create momentum for Allstate's heightened sustainability efforts, and identify opportunities associated with environmental responsibility and climate change

The Enterprise Risk and Return Dashboard Report, prepared quarterly for the ERRC, Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, is one of the tools used to evaluate key risks, strategies, and actions This Dashboard Report allows Allstate to compare risk exposure with the company's enterprise action plan targets by capturing key information and metrics on material issues, such as catastrophic and severe weather events, quarterly auto and property insurance underwriting results, business continuity, disaster recovery plans, and investment concentrations Regulatory changes, customer behavior trends, and Allstate's current public reputation are also considered To the extent climate change results in more natural catastrophic events or an increase in the severity of catastrophe events or both, the cost of reinsurance or other risk transfer mechanisms (eg, catastrophe bonds) is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers Emerging risks and opportunities are also identified and reported as part of the quarterly Dashboard reporting process
 
Risks and opportunities are generally assessed at an enterprise or business unit level rather than an asset or localized level The cross-functional Sustainability Leadership Committee ensures that risks and opportunities confronting company assets are considered when evaluating climate change-related risks at the enterprise level The Sustainability Leadership Committee completes an annual review of Allstate's operations, stakeholder expectations, and competitive actions in this space to identify internal opportunities related to climate change The Committee considers potential opportunities related to employee engagement, current and future regulation, improved operational efficiencies, and customer and consumer expectations Allstate's Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, who leads the Sustainability Leadership Committee, reports to the senior -management team on the efforts and assessments of the committee

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers, and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Additionally, there is an opportunity for Allstate to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change on our company This opportunity could enhance customer and consumer consideration thereby potentially increasing Allstate's customer base

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events across the United States We may incur catastrophe losses in our auto and property business in excess of: (1) those experienced in prior years, (2) the average expected level used in pricing, (3) our current reinsurance coverage limits, or (4) the estimated loss from external hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material effect on operating results and financial condition For example, our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which totaled $36 billion, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which totaled $23 billion

To the extent that climate change impacts valuation of commercial real estate properties or municipalities in which we invest, our investment results would be impacted Allstate's investments throughout the United States could be affected by risks associated with other physical climate drivers

Increases in claims resulting from future extreme weather events could lead to increased operational costs The highest risk areas are major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States

Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires, the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, the number and severity of claims submitted by our customers and the results of our Allstate Protection business Property insured by Allstate throughout the United States could be affected by changes in precipitation and extreme droughts

Property catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires, fires following earthquakes, and other catastrophes We continue to attempt to capture our reinsurance cost in premium rates as allowed by state regulatory authorities To the extent climate change results in more frequent catastrophic weather events, the cost of reinsurance is likely to rise, resulting in higher prices or unavailability of property insurance for consumers

Allstate supports changes in the regulatory environment, including promoting the creation of government sponsored, privately-funded solutions for mega-catastrophes, that will make insurance more available and affordable

Allstate is engaged in an on-going evaluation of climate change as it relates to the company's future risk exposure, which may be affected by the federal government's ability to prepare for and respond to climate¬change-related catastrophes (eg sea-level rise) Allstate regularly monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities, including 
those related to climate change, using fluid risk identification processes that reflect a continuously shifting external and internal risk environment and reports to the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and ERRC Changes in regulations, customer behavior, Allstate's reputation, and other risks are considered

"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change
Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs
 
These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

ENCOURAGING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
(GRI: 414-417; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
As a global company MAPFREs environmental commitment is also focused on promoting environmental responsibility among employees, suppliers, customers and business managers, public and private associations and organisations and other stakeholders connected to MAPFREs activity, involving them in the achievement of goals, developing awareness actions and good practices, contributing to the development and dissemination of scientific knowledge and participating in environmental forums
Public bodies and authorities
MAPFRE participates in the main sustainability forums, such as the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and the Global Compact It is also very active in other forums, such as the National Congress of the Environment (CONAMA) and participates in conferences and working groups related to the analysis and evaluation of environmental risks, climate change and greenhouse gases MAPFRE also participates in initiatives designed to raise the publics awareness of the challenges posed by sustainable development and the risks associated with climate change
An example of this has been the participation, for the fourth year, in Earth Hour, in which the MAPFRE companies in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Colombia and Spain have taken part In addition to participating in this initiative with the symbolic gesture of turning off the company's neon signs and its advertising billboard lights for one hour in 34 main buildings and 204 commercial offices, employees have been encouraged through the Corporate Portal to take part from their homes
The Group also backs global environmental programmes such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, of which MAPFRE is a signatory, and in whose 2012 ""Iberia 125"" report it has advanced 11 points to an 83 disclosure score, and a C-band performance score
A broad range of measures has been adopted in Brazil and Puerto Rico (the companies there are implementing the Corporate Environmental Strategic Plan), with many more planned in the short term in these two countries and the United States
Suppliers
As established by the Principles for Sustainable Insurance, Environmental Responsibility is propagated in the value chain MAPFRE contributes to its suppliers' environmental performance by establishing selection criteria that assess their environmental conduct, and by ensuring that environmental clauses feature systematically in contracts Environmental clauses in bidding specifications help to foster sustainability in suppliers, as do sustainability criteria in procurement specifications and in the matrices used for comparing tenders, with particular attention to large corporate supplies 
In addition, it issues guidelines to suppliers of businesses or services that impact the environment and operate in environmentally certified work centres with a view to informing them of best practice in their business lines
Compliance with these measures is audited by MAPFREs in-house audit department
Meanwhile, MAPFREs Environmental Services suppliers form part of a constant evaluation process that guarantees the continuity of their authorizations and their service capacity
 
Employees
(GRI: 414-417, FS4; DJSI: 252, FTSE4Good)
MAPFRE employees in Spain received 2,693 hours of environmental training in 2012 MAPFREs environmental commitment remains a core component of the corporate training that all employees follow In addition, MAPFREs environmental department takes part as a speaker in a range of environmental training courses given to third parties
During 2012, participation in the Car Sharing project, which encourages employees to share private vehicles for their everyday journey to work, was even easier thanks to direct access on the en Persona corporate portal
Employee participation has been essential in the Green Signature project carried out in 2012 to establish a corporate awareness message on printing emails, with a winner to be selected from the 594 creative proposals sent by MAPFRE employees from 29 countries
General information on MAPFREs Environmental and Energy Policy can be accessed in the Internal Website Employee Area A special section with information and precise indications on environmental management and energy saving has also been created in this space for application in certain work centres
MAPFREs environment portal received more than 400 visits in 2012, and includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 55 enquiries during the year
Any enquiry or suggestion regarding MAPFREs environmental record can be addressed to the following e-mail address  medioambiente@mapfrecom


MAPFRE has adhered to the Principles for Sustainable Insurance promoted by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEPFI) that were presented at Rio+20 Sustainable Development summit, held in Río de Janeiro (Brazil)

The Going Green Team was established with an objective to investigate opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of our business operation  This included making our current recycling program more comprehensive and robust, reducing our energy consumption, using sustainable paper products, purchasing equipment with energy star ratings, and doing business with vendors who certify sustainability in disposal of equipment

Reducing energy consumption reduces greenhouse gases and expenses  By reprogramming our building management system that controls our HVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) and lighting controls, migrating Data Center equipment to Blade technology and to a virtualization server environment we have reduced our energy consumption by and average of 620,000 kilowatt hours and our HVAC condenser water system by 202,000 gallons per year

Procurement for both building and technology products and equipment contributes to reducing our carbon footprint  All of our copiers were replaced with energy efficient equipment that will reduce energy and the copiers were set to default to duplex (double sided) printing which reduces paper usage  40 network printers were replaced with energy efficient printers and all monitors were replaced with LCD flat screens  All replaced equipment was disposed through a certified vendor or sold to our associates

Penn Mutual continues to recycle an average of 43 tons per year, which includes mixed office paper, confidential shredding, cardboard, aluminum, glass, tin and plastic  Paper towel, toilet paper and soap dispensers and products were replaced to reduce consumption  Paper towel consumption was reduced by 30%, toilet paper product was changed with a product that reduced packaging by 96% and hand soap was changed from liquid to foam which reduced consumption by 57%

All toilet flushometers were replaced with auto flush devices which reduce water usage  All restroom faucets were replaced with automatic devices to reduce water consumption

At Penn Mutual, we are currently renovating our corporate facility in Horsham PA An important part of our renovation is to reduce the amount of trash that is sent to the landfills By partnering with Revolution Recovery and the Paul Restall Company we have been able to divert 8213% or 11153 tons of construction waste from landfills Items recycled included carpet, ceiling tiles, light bulbs and commingled metal, wood, plastics, drywall, fiberglass and salvages materials which is donated or sold to woodworkers, artists, homeowners and non pro-profits for reuse

As previously reported, Markel is in the process of consolidating all of their Markel North America data centers into a primary and backup site both of which are located in North America  In addition, Markel continues to make significant progress in migrating the Markel North American associate base to virtualized desktops  Virtualization is a process whereby applications are run in separate, isolated partitions (separate virtual machines) within a single server Widely used in datacenters, each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application, and can be moved or copied from one server to another for load balancing or to expand processing capability Along with greater utilization of hardware, this ""live migration"" feature is one of the major benefits of using virtual servers

The Company's affiliated non-insurance operations tend to engage in light manufacturing or service businesses and are not significant producers of emissions

The combination of data center consolidation and virtualization of computing environments is also expected to significantly reduce power consumption in support of business activities

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings

Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well¬being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions""In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categoriesWith regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 19983 Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

" Therefore both aspects are included in the Business Strategy
Commitment to conserving natural resources is an equally important part of our corpo-rate responsibility strategy, given that our economic success is inseparably linked with protecting people and the environment With this in mind, we are recording our envi-ronmental data with increasing precision: in 2012, a total of 80% of all Munich Re Group-wide employees in 31 units were covered by our environmental management system, with 30% working in units that have been certified to ISO-14001
To help raise public awareness regarding climate change, we endeavor to set a good example ourselves: by 2015, we will make business operations throughout our Group carbon-neutral The first step was to reduce emissions Group-wide by at least 10% per employee, based on emissions in 2009 In a second step, we are neutralizing unavoid-able CO2 emissions by means of appropriate certificates Our Munich site has been carbon-neutral since 2009, as have the major locations of ERGO Germany since 2011
This objective was achieved for the whole reinsurance group in the reporting year 2012 Since the end of 2012, for example, more than 3087 acres of solar panels have been supplying power to our Princeton corporate campus with a maximum generating capacity of 3042 gigawatt hours per year Our subsidiary DKV Seguros in Spain, which already achieved the objective in 2007, last year became the first European insurer to have its products certified as carbon-neutral Altogether, we have saved more than 5,500 tones of CO2 globally since 2009 with our consistent environmental manage-ment
Source: Annual Report Munich Re Group 2012, page 113
To mitigate CC, in-house green building and energy efficiency play a vital part in facility manage-ment/procurement This approach is supported internally by an Environmental Management System (EMS) and a Group-wide target of carbon neutrality by 2015 with a global reduction of 10% in our emissions (baseline 2009), which will in turn reduce operational costs This being achieved through more efficient energy use, less business travel, use of green power, investment in renewable energy and the off-setting of any remaining carbon emissions through the purchase of carbon credits Various smaller-scale projects to mitigate emissions are already in place Furthermore we concentrate espe-cially on making fewer business trips and reducing our consumption of paper, water and energy Each entity follows their own Carbon Reduction Plan as the local environment/surrounding is playing a cru-cial part, in order to support the Group-wide target
The EMS currently covers 75% of our employees and will be expanded further by 2015 Our EMS monitors our CO2 emissions annually, enabling us to develop measures to reduce them  detailed re-duction plans are in place

""Commitment to conserving natural resources is an equally important part of our corpo-rate responsibility strategy, given that our economic success is inseparably linked with protecting people and the environment With this in mind, we are recording our envi-ronmental data with increasing precision: in 2012, a total of 80% of all Munich Re Group-wide employees in 31 units were covered by our environmental management system, with 30% working in units that have been certified to ISO-14001
To help raise public awareness regarding climate change, we endeavor to set a good example ourselves: by 2015, we will make business operations throughout our Group carbon-neutral The first step was to reduce emissions Group-wide by at least 10% per employee, based on emissions in 2009 In a second step, we are neutralizing unavoid-able CO2 emissions by means of appropriate certificates Our Munich site has been carbon-neutral since 2009, as have the major locations of ERGO Germany since 2011
This objective was achieved for the whole reinsurance group in the reporting year 2012 Since the end of 2012, for example, more than 3087 acres of solar panels have been supplying power to our Princeton corporate campus with a maximum generating capacity of 3042 gigawatt hours per year Our subsidiary DKV Seguros in Spain, which already achieved the objective in 2007, last year became the first European insurer to have its products certified as carbon-neutral Altogether, we have saved more than 5,500 tones of CO2 globally since 2009 with our consistent environmental manage-ment""
Source: Annual Report Munich Re Group 2012, page 113
To mitigate CC, in-house green building and energy efficiency play a vital part in facility manage-ment/procurement This approach is supported internally by an Environmental Management System (EMS) and a Group-wide target of carbon neutrality by 2015 with a global reduction of 10% in our emissions (baseline 2009), which will in turn reduce operational costs This being achieved through more efficient energy use, less business travel, use of ""green"" power, investment in renewable energy and the off-setting of any remaining carbon emissions through the purchase of carbon credits Various smaller-scale projects to mitigate emissions are already in place Furthermore we concentrate espe-cially on making fewer business trips and reducing our consumption of paper, water and energy Each entity follows their own Carbon Reduction Plan as the local environment/surrounding is playing a cru-cial part, in order to support the Group-wide target
The EMS currently covers 75% of our employees and will be expanded further by 2015 Our EMS monitors our CO2 emissions annually, enabling us to develop measures to reduce them - detailed re-duction plans are in place

Chubb has been a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation purposes and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policy holders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities

In 2015, for example, a priority initiative in 2015 involved developing an enhanced flood risk management tool to give underwriters and risk managers improved modeling, underwriting and portfolio management capabilities

Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a shorter-term view of event frequency that is higher than the long-term historical frequency Standard & Poors has rated Chubbs ERM process Strong, placing it among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurance companies in S&Ps May 2015 ERM rating report  

Chubbs process accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Although minimal, direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur in places where Chubb has offices Chubb has developed a Business Continuity Program, which has been tested during severe weather events, and Chubbs operations have functioned effectively

Chubb identifies all known and emerging risks that could have a significant impact on overall capital levels and financial results Our analysis of the impact of risks ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum (PML) calculation) Regarding the potential effects of catastrophe losses, we continue to closely monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world

"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED ranking, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations  Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Workplace Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the CSR Council for support and funding including capital investment, associate involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  The CSR Council reviews programmatic initiatives in contribution to the overall business strategy with CSR Stewards

Energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions reductions goals are the most important components of the short-term strategy to address climate change  For this approach, short-term is defined as less than 3 years  Working toward these goals influences our operational practices by focusing our team on energy efficient facilities operations, and has begun to influence the way we interact with our supply chain It has spurred direct investment in resources, both financial and personnel, to focus on climate change mitigation within our owned and leased facilities These investments have enabled Humana to implement projects such as HVAC upgrades, lighting, the installation of vending misers, and other building upgrades to ensure that energy is being used as efficiently as possible at Humana's facilities  all steps toward our reduction targets We have already started implementing workspace optimization efforts, which will increase the density of the workspace, while also decreasing vacancy in buildings For example, facilities consolidation in Cincinnati enabled us to reduce our facility space needs by 72,000 square feet and therefore reduced energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions 

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities, thus having an overall positive impact on Humana's footprint In 2014, approximately 25 percent of Humanas 57,000 employees worked from home

In addition, Humana has coordinated with suppliers across their businesses to better understand ways that suppliers can partner with Humana to drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency The initial focus of these initiatives has centered on Humanas efforts to reduce waste generation and waste taken to landfills throughout the companys supply chain  These efforts will have upstream and downstream impacts on Humanas operations with respect to the embodied energy and carbon of raw materials consumed, as well as the emissions and energy related with their disposal, be it by landfill or beneficial reuse or recycling

Our long-term strategy (generally considered to be 5-10 years) is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our CSR Stewards committee works with Workplace Solutions leaders to review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability HR leaders refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets Many of our facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years), whether these are leased or owned properties Humana has developed a sustainable real estate approach to ensure that investments in these facilities take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs

It is difficult to predict the future and determine how much of an influence climate change may have on any atmospheric caused risk We can make certain estimates as to where the risk may increase (eg coastal communities from sea level rise) due to climate change over the next century but, for example, we do not know how well as a society we will adapt to these changes in risk going forward through better zoning, building practices etc Exclusive of climate change the costs associated with atmospheric related events are increasing due to changes in wealth, construction costs, and our desire to live in coastal and other exposed areas Our business relies on understanding and anticipating to the extent possible all risks; current, future, actual, and possible Losses relating to natural catastrophes are growing and changes in climate will lead to more physical losses in other sectors including agriculture and tourism as well as coastal areas, woodlands and in locations prone to flash flooding We can use our tools and technology to estimate this impact based on current scientific projections

Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local
Safety and Security Officer, Business Continuity Manager, and an Incident
Management/Business Continuity Team in place All reasonable measures are taken to
ensure operational effectiveness even in critical and emergency situations We do not
consider climate risk to be a major threat to the operational effectiveness of Swiss Re
locations Regardless, the potential for climate change to increase losses led to the
development of Swiss Re's climate change strategy and provided the impetus for increased

company's own carbon footprint

Legislative or regulatory actions taken by Federal and State governments in response to
climate change may pose new risks but also opportunities for a company like Swiss Re
Regulation, in the US or on the international level, leading to an agreement on how to
manage a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will spur the development of renewable
energy projects, and may lead to increased demand for insurance products offered by our
company As an example, Swiss Re offers customized products such as stream flow and
precipitation hedges to hydroelectric producers to compensate for additional costs
associated with electricity production lost due to reduced water flows Swiss Re could also benefit from the increased demand for other products, such as conventional re/insurance policies to cover construction and operational risks associated with the development of solar power For example, Swiss Re provides reinsurance cover to the Desert Sunlight Solar project in Riverside County, California This is a 550 MW facility currently under construction and will eventually provide enough power to run 165,000 homes

Energy efficiency has always been an important area of focus for The Hanover More than 20 years ago, The Hanover began a journey to reduce its carbon footprint From an investment in ultra-efficient ice harvesting thermal storage to cool its buildings, to upgrading fan systems with high efficiency variable speed drive motors, installing continuous commissioning energy management systems, upgrading  much of its lighting to efficient LED lighting, the installation of white roofs on many buildings and recently completing a multi-million dollar project to replace over 300 windows with high efficiency, energy saving low-e double pane windows at its Headquarters facility, The Hanover has worked tirelessly to reduce its energy consumption The culmination of these and many other energy conservation projects have resulted in the achievement of the prestigious EPA Energy Star certification for the past ten consecutive years for The Hanovers owned properties This certification affirms top quartile performance in energy usage according to EPA guidelines 

The Hanover has also established a leadership position in the area of environmental responsibility For the past nine consecutive years, 100% of the electricity consumed at the 800K square foot HQ campus and a total of over 50% of the entire electricity demand across The Hanovers entire office portfolio is offset by certified Renewable Wind Energy Certificates In addition, for over a decade, The Hanover has worked diligently to improve and strengthen its Green Cleaning program This program improves indoor air quality, reduces water consumption and energy usage, and utilizes cleaning products that have minimal impact to the waste stream The Hanover also takes pride in its innovative and robust recycling and compost programs which year after year effectively diverts close to 40% of the total waste stream at its HQ facility away from landfills  

The Hanover recognizes the impact its employees have on the environment as they commute to and from work With this in mind, The Hanover has long supported the use of alternate forms of travel to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions With the recognition that electric cars materially contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions and a healthier planet, we have invested in electric car charging stations for employees and visitors at our HQ facility With Massachusetts anticipating that 300,000 electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, we are proud to help pave the way for widespread use of alternative fuel vehicles  The Hanover also supports employee flexible work arrangements, allowing many employees to work from home, further improving air quality and reducing traffic on our congested roadways For these efforts, in 2018, The Hanover earned the ECO Leadership award from Massachusetts Department of Transportation for delivering excellence in commuter options 

Beyond the measurable results above, each year The Hanover encourages active hands on employee participation by hosting an Employee Earth Day Celebration, to educate and showcase energy efficiency and environmental conservation This much-anticipated event includes interactive exhibits, booths and presentations by internal groups, vendors and other exhibitors that invest their time and energy to make ours a more energy efficient, green-friendly planet Employees are encouraged to attend the event, visit with the exhibitors, learn and become an active participant in reducing their carbon footprint not only at work, but in their homes and communities as well 

All of these efforts have a significant impact on our organization Most important, our sustainability efforts and programs make a meaningful impact in reducing The Hanovers carbon footprint We have also witnessed a significant reduction in energy consumption and experienced a material cost savings as a result of our efforts Finally, as we continue to strive to recruit the best talent in the industry, our sustainability practices have helped us attract more environmentally-conscious employees, especially early-in-career talent, who view sustainability as a baseline requirement for their employer, and will continuously challenge The Hanover to deliver even more going forward

Climate change, including global warming and sea-level rise, is expected to result in increased annual variability in weather-related events, including wildfires, convective storms, winter storms, hurricanes and floods Damage resulting from such events is generally covered by policies underwritten by California Casualty members and California Casualty has instituted a number of methods to limit its exposure to such losses, including the following:
1 Product Distribution
a Auto-only in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas
2 Underwriting
a Minimum distance-to-coast underwriting acceptability rules for Property risks located in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia
b Use of ISO ""FireLine"" to qualify new Property risks in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington
3 Pricing
a Effective 4/1/2014, rates are varied by ISO ""FireLine"" scores in California
b Rates are varied by roof age Effective dates vary by state
c Introduced higher deductible options

Please note that the Companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the Companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Perils considered when assessing the potential risks posed by climate change include:
 Hurricane and tropical storm
 Tornado
 Flood
 Drought
 Wildfire

Hurricane
North Atlantic hurricanes and tropical storms typically impact states between Texas and Maine The Group identifies and models its hurricane risks in 23 states that could be affected by these perils, and on an annual basis has its exposures modeled in an alternative vendor model with a broader set of states

As noted in section 3, over the period from 1880 onwards there is a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling hurricanes Some of the weather and climate conditions that make it easier for hurricanes to form in the Atlantic Basin also appear to impair the likelihood of landfall For example, hurricanes that form further from land are less likely to maintain their structure long enough to make landfall as damaging events In the long term the current consensus view is that there will be fewer hurricanes, but that these will be of greater intensity However the same science that provides this long term view also indicates it will be many decades before we see the these changes

The Group closely monitors the forecast numbers of tropical storms and hurricanes for each season, investigates all available vendor models, and tests alternative assumptions on the potential frequency and severity of such events

Each individual property location is assessed for catastrophe risk, with particular focus on those nearest the coast and / or near river estuaries

Tornado
As noted in section 3, over the period from 1950 onwards the number of tornadoes is not increasing In older calendar years there was significant under-reporting of the weakest category of tornado (EF-0); if one considers all other tornado strengths there is no trend in the frequency of these events or in the number falling into each strength category EF-1 to EF-5

When tornado insured losses are normalized for changes in exposures (for example, the number and values of the buildings and contents, often in areas that were previously agricultural land), these too show no increasing trend

The Group models tornado losses in every state within the USA, and has also revalued the tornadoes reported by the ISO Property Claims Service (PCS) from 1950 onwards to allow for changes in exposure as an additional data source 

Flood
As noted in section 3, flood losses arising from river and surface water are decreasing as a percentage of GDP 
The majority of the property policies issued by the Group exclude losses covered by flood In those policies that do cover flood, many have flood sublimits

Drought & Wildfire
Drought and wildfire are strongly connected One study looking at data through to 2002 indicated that fully half the variability in wildfire (measured by acres burned) arises as a result of drought conditions
http://viewofficeappslivecom/op/viewaspx?src=http%3A%2F%2Ftiorg%2FFire%26droughtdoc

As noted in section 3, the current period of drought is not as severe as periods seen in the past Furthermore, there was a drought in the latter part of the 16th century that was far more severe than any subsequent drought in North America

The Group does not write the two business lines that would be most significantly impacted by drought (crop multi-peril) or by wildfire (homeowners) Consequently our losses arising from such events are minimal

 As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides All of these are part of going green
 IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
 Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong 
"	5	"This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction For example, we provide brochures that outline how to reduce wildfire risk We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have impact-resistant roof materials Loss control services are available for commercial and farm/ranch accounts Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program

At American Family Insurance, we recognize our connection to the natural environment and are dedicated to minimizing negative operational impact American Family Insurance recognizes climate change is causing broad environmental, social, and economic impacts that put our customers, communities, and industry at risk We believe it is our responsibility to address these impacts directly

In 2020, we signed the ""We Are Still In"" pledge, a commitment to meet to requirements laid out by the Paris Climate Accord and encouraged other companies to do the same We support the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which committed 197 countries, including the US, to work together to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by limiting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy

To position American Family as a leader in environmental sustainability and climate action  and to ensure weve prepared our enterprise for the impacts of changing environmental conditions  we created our first Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy in 2019 This strategy is reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis

American Family Insurance has an energy management strategy with the goal of continuously improving efficiency across owned facilities The strategy is managed by a cross-disciplinary team that includes representation from Facilities, and Information Services and Data Center Management It includes rigorous efficiency and emission targets out to 2025 with a continuous improvement cycle for strategic planning updates annually

The enterprise now has three Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified facilities in its portfolio (Eden Prairie, MN and two in Madison, WI) Complementary programs include building envelope upgrades, green roofs, HVAC fixtures and controls, retro-commissioning projects, electrical fixture and controls updates, back up generation and behavioral modifications such as employee programs to power down equipment when it is not in use

In 2020, the American Family enterprise committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 for our scope 1, scope 2 (market-based) and scope 3 emissions The scope 3 emissions covered by this commitment include purchased goods and services (from paper and cloud services only), fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2), waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, use of goods sold, and end of life products To reach this goal, we are continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through implementing energy efficiency projects, increasing on-site renewable energy production, leveraging renewable purchasing options, transitioning 95% EV or hybrid fleet by 2030, and diverting 90% of waste generated at our owned facilities from the landfill As part of this carbon neutrality commitment, we plan to reduce our emissions 50% by 2025 For unavoidable emissions, we are committed to purchasing carbon offsets where applicable We consider this target science-based because it aligns with an over 42% annual linear reduction rate over the target period, which is consistent with the 15°C aligned target ambition

Climate change risk currently ranks lower on the risk spectrum when compared to liquidity, durations, interest rate, and asset class

Furthermore from an investment portfolio standpoint we believe any risks or opportunities associated with climate change, such as carbon and water restrictions, are generally priced into the cost of the investment through the market; any potential arbitrage opportunities would have imbedded investment risk which we believe to be inappropriate for us to take given our overall risk tolerance profile

Given the nature of our underwritten liability we do not currently assess the correlation between climate risks our underwriting and investments Due to the relative short-tailed liability associated with the health underwriting risk profile we believe it is not as critical as it would be for a life company, or P&C company, to structure our portfolio with a similar duration

Futhermore, American Family is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies 

In 2015, American Family partnered with Nest Labs to offer Nest products to insured homeowners in an effort to reduce losses related to fire, water damage and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning

* IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
* Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that ""green"" building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first responders--for example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of ""building strong""
In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Family's corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies

platforms such as the Geneva Association and Clinton Global Initiative Swiss Re is also a
founding member of the Principles of Sustainable Insurance initiative which was launched
in 2012 Swiss Re believes a commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint is
key to having a robust and effective climate change program Having strong credentials in
the climate/sustainability area provides additional value to a company like Swiss Re as it
can help attract socially responsible investors as well as make the company a more
desirable place to work for top university graduates and other prospective employees

The companies in NAIC Group 181 participate in a dedicated Climate Change strategy
sponsored by the ultimate parent of the Group, Swiss Re Ltd (""Swiss Re"") A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003 Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral The plan was to do this by 2013 However, through a mix of emission reduction measures and the purchase of high quality carbon off-sets, this target was achieved in late 2007

As part of Swiss Re's commitment to reducing the company's carbon footprint we set
specific goals for a CO2 emissions intensity reduction of 506%/employee by 2013 against
reference year 2003 (strengthened three times from the original 15% to its current level of 506%) The reduction target was exceeded in 2013 as the company recorded a total
reduction of emissions per employee of 565% since 2003 After the successful completion of the company's 10 year carbon reduction plan in 2013 new targets are being developed for the period 2013 - 2020 Swiss Re also set a target reduction of energy intensity/employee by 20% by 2013 against reference year 2003 (a new goal set in
2008) A major contributing factor to the reduction of emissions is the company's
commitment to purchase renewable energy wherever this is feasible 100% of the power
consumed by our US operations comes from renewable energy At the end of 2013,
energy intensity across the Group was 465% lower than in 2003  and down by 80%
from 2012 The improvement during 2013 was partly due to lower power usage from our
newly constructed, energy-efficient office building in Fort Wayne, Indiana Furthermore, at our Americas head office in Armonk, New York a program was started to replace the entire lighting system with energy efficient LED lights

In 2007, to encourage our staff to reduce their personal carbon footprints, Swiss Re
introduced an employee subsidy program (COYou2 - Reduce and Gain) Subsidies of up to
CHF 5 000/employee are paid for employee investment in low carbon technology To date
approximately 9 000 subsidy payments have been made worldwide including
approximately 2500 in 2013 Over 250 of these payments went to US based employees
The top three most popular investments made in the US were in energy efficient
appliances, doors and windows and hybrid vehicles Due to the success of the program, a

"  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed   It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts

Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total $495 billion operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,525 million operating costs in 2018

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level 

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our employees as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change
"	3	"If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed
If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts
Climate change risks may also affect Humana's premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes) We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts
Risks driven by changes in regulation
The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humana's total $495 billion operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal
Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts
Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters

The American Family Insurance Group encourages policyholders to prevent or mitigate losses caused by covered perils, whether or not the losses can be attributed to climate change  This includes providing customers with informational newsletters and brochures related to loss reduction  For example, the Main Street America Insurance companies provide brochures that outline hurricane preparedness tips and plans  We also offer discounts in many states for customers that have hurricane or wind mitigation devices Flood coverage is available through our agents via the National Flood Insurance Program 
Furthermore, American Family Insurance is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change

IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

In 2014, American Family Insurance partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support IBHS researchers over the next 25 years in identifying the effects of aging on residential roofing materials, with the ultimate goal of making residential roofs last longer and leak less ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen scientifically instrumented roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Family Insurances corporate headquarters This is a part of a larger study driven by IBHS and other participating member companies

For example, we always encourage our auto policyholders to use telematics, not only because it makes drivers safer, but also because it encourages drivers to be more fuel efficient (wasteful speeding and rapid starts/stops are recorded) In fact, the company offers a bundle of fleet services including telematics, incenting them to use the devices to improve fleet operation efficiencies We also advise our fleet clients of risk management best practices, such as selecting drivers based upon their driving histories, including but not limited to speeding and reckless driving (which wastes fuel and results in greater emissions)
Our insureds understand that more miles driven and unnecessary personal use of company vehicles by employees increases their exposure to risk and usually their premium as well Insureds may be advised that reducing unnecessary miles driven and personal use of company vehicles by employees can reduce their premiums and also have a positive impact on climate change by reducing fuel usage and emissions
During our property surveys we always look at the age and condition of HVAC systems, electrical services, etc When these systems exceed 20 years of age, they are more likely to produce property claims from fires, etc When we identify these conditions it is our standard practice to recommend that the client replace or upgrade their systems with units meeting current codes and standards Although we dont specifically ask insureds to replace old inefficient systems for efficiency purposes, our practices does have the effect of encouraging insureds to replace older systems with newer ones (which are also more efficient in virtually all cases) The use of LED lighting in warehouses is another example where ProSight and other insurers encourage clients to replace older, (inefficient & dangerous) metal halide lighting with newer systems that save tremendous amounts of energy (and are safer)  Additionally, loss control surveys also include assessment of risk exposures including vulnerability to flooding, power outages, brush fires, etc If we find situations which warrant improvement, we make recommendations to client to help them reduce chances of loss This has the side benefit of helping them deal more effectively with the impacts of climate change on their local environment

" To better prepare for inevitable natural catastrophes, Allstate recommends an improved system of catastrophe preparedness and protection that is financially sound and organized to efficiently utilize the resources and expertise of private and public entities, including those of local, state, and federal governments Currently, a significant gap exists between the available coverage and necessary protection for major natural catastrophes because of the limited capacity of the private insurance and reinsurance sectors and the financial burden caused by these catastrophes

A national backstop for state catastrophe funds that is fully funded by a portion of private insurance premiums would increase the private insurance market's ability to respond to large-scale natural catastrophes The plan we support would not eliminate private reinsurance, which allows insurance companies to spread the risk of catastrophic losses and which is essential to the private insurance market Private reinsurers will continue to play an integral role in the insurance market, and private reinsurers will be encouraged to participate in providing capacity to the national backstop This plan would spread risk even more and provide a guaranteed source of reinsurance protection after major events or a series of events that could destabilize the market or even threaten a private market collapse

The plan we support will provide additional, needed capacity to the market, above and beyond what the private reinsurance market provides It will not eliminate private reinsurance; it will supplement it

Allstate specifically supports the Homeowners and Taxpayers Protection Act of 2013 (HR noi) because it includes the features of the plan we have discussed in these comments This legislation was drafted with input from experts in catastrophe management and actuarial science and improves upon similar legislation introduced in the past The sooner this legislation becomes law, the sooner and the better we can prepare and protect America from future natural catastrophes

Allstate also engages consumers and customers on the topic of disaster preparedness through vehicles like the Allstate Blog (http://blogallstatecom/), allstatecorn (http://wwwallstatecom/tools-and-resources/be-aware-and-prepareaspx), and the distribution of disaster preparation and awareness brochures to customers by agency owners

"  The Group includes several large subgroups of companies as well as a number of smaller subgroups and companies that operate independently While some of the larger subgroups own their own buildings and can thus have maximum control of their physical operations, many of the companies lease or rent the properties in which they operate, and therefore have less control of the physical aspects of their operations

Recycling of paper, glass and plastic are encouraged in all operations Reductions in energy usage are effected through the use of technology by encouraging electronic communication verses paper usage whenever available Imaging technology is used to replace paper usage and long term information storage Updating computer equipment regularly allows the Group to take advantage of newer technology, often reducing energy usage as well as adding more computing power while using less equipment Intelligent usage of energy is encouraged in all operations as a cost control issue as well as the positive impact that has for reducing the operational energy footprints

The two largest operational subgroups are General Reinsurance and GEICO  General Reinsurance has recently relocated its corporate headquarters in Stamford, CT, moving from an energy inefficient office environment, to an open floor design (no associates have offices, from the CEO on down) and specialized glass exterior that are energy efficient and result in cost savings to the company   

GEICO has the largest number of employees and physical operations among the Berkshire Hathaway group of insurance companies The following is GEICOs summary of their response to this question It serves as a model for its affiliates

GEICO is making significant strides in its Green initiatives, which includes measures to limit its greenhouse gas emissions The company has established green teams to focus on the issues and establish improvements The company encourages its associates to carpool, bike, or use public transportation, and it provides certain benefits to reduce the cost for its employees to use public transportation The company has increased its use of teleconferencing to reduce travel 

Here are several examples of changes implemented as a result of the green team efforts:

In GEICOs corporate headquarters it has eliminated all small departmental pantries and combined them into centralized pantries located strategically throughout the 600Ksf facility using strictly Energy Star approved appliances  More than 300 toasters were eliminated as well as toaster ovens, microwaves, portable and large refrigerators  The drastic reduction of appliances within the facility resulted in significant annual energy usage savings 

In a $2M+ project implemented in one of its regions, GEICO converted parking lot lighting from 400w metal halide to 255w LED  This region also switched from 32w T8 lamps to 25w T8 lamps on the production floors  100w metal halide lamps have been replaced by 20w LED in the stairwells

In an effort to reduce lighting to no more than the industry lighting levels GEICO removed lamps from 2x4 parabolic and other type of multi-lamp light fixtures where appropriate to conserve energy 

Many GEICO departments have implemented 2 sided printing versus printing on a single side of paper

One regional office installed a paper shredder in the vicinity of their loading dock to do its own shredding and bailing of paper

One regional office has solicited an energy consultant and the review and resulting changes implemented has resulted in significant electricity and natural gas usage savings 

GEICO has continued to increase the number of four cylinder vehicles in its Corporate Fleet  Furthermore, the average number of gallons of gasoline purchased has been reduced and as a result the CO2 emissions have been reduced The company is exploring the use of diesel and hybrid vehicles to further reduce emissions The company is also increasing the use of van pools for employees

The use of non-volatile organic ingredients paint is preferred wherever possible within its facilities

GEICO has implemented water saving measures at its corporate headquarters by remodeling restrooms with water saving faucets, 16 gal flush toilets and 125 gal flush urinals  The faucets have preset temperature controls as well  Green biodegradable restroom paper products are being used in some offices

GEICO also promotes the use of technology to its customer base to reduce the amount of paper mail it sends It encourages its customers to transact business and receive information from the company via email and the internet, which reduces the paper footprint impact on the environment

The core of GEICOs green efforts are the establishment of both a Recycling Program and an Energy Report Card Furthermore, GEICO has made strides in reducing the impact that its Fleet has on the environment The Recycling Program is aimed at reducing the waste generation at all GEICO facilities, including proper disposal of all recyclable materials such as paper, aluminum cans and plastic bottles, ink toner cartridges, electronic waste, fluorescent bulbs, construction waste and rechargeable batteries GEICO further reduces its paper usage by double sided printing on all photocopiers and network printers

There are hundreds of office supply products that are made from recycled materials that GEICO procures and stocks for the entire company from a national supplier The frequency by which recycled material office supplies is used depends on the product being ordered

The Energy Report Card is aimed at administering best practices at all GEICO facilities to reduce energy consumption In its continuing efforts to conserve energy, GEICO  has implemented the following changes in its corporate headquarters during the past year:

1)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old centrifugal chillers with brand new centrifugal chillers  
2)	Replaced two (2) 50+ year old boilers with brand new boilers
3)	Replaced all 3M window film throughout the entire facility with 486,000 useable sf
4)	Replaced all mushroom parking lot lights with LED mushroom lights  This was in excess of 200 fixtures

Previous activities related to energy usage reduction relate to:

The use of a heat exchanger that takes advantage of free cooling in temperatures of 55 degrees Fahrenheit or less during the year

Installation of contemporary 2 megawatt emergency backup power generators equipped with the most advanced low NOX emissions equipment

Reduced demand for cooling power in data centers by both alternating the operation of redundant AC units and proactively sealing cable cutout holes that can save appreciably on the energy consumed for data center equipment asset cooling  A further measure to reduce energy consumption was to raise thermostat set points such that AC units runs less often while at the same time providing suitable cooling for the intended space

Installation of lighting controllers which permit powering down entire floors of facilities lighting during non-business hours

	Removing excess light bulbs in workspaces based upon National Illumination Society lighting standards

Replacing CRT computer monitors with flat screen monitor technology

Personal computers themselves are set to shut themselves off after a period of non-use (at night)

Copiers and printers are programmed to take advantage of sleep-mode inherent to the device when not in use

Deployment of new energy-wise vending machines

The following projects are in progress:

1)	Replaced the 20+ year old Building Automated System (BAS) that controls all HVAC throughout the facility  This Phase 1 projects to cut all main constant running AHU over to VFD technology to permit ramping up to the building HVAC load versus running continuously at full speed is 60% complete 
2)	Install window shades to compliment the window films ability to reject heat from the sun further reducing our cooling load on the building  This project will be completed in November

"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors 

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

Bankers considers modeled and historic loss trends to determine reinsurance structure and attachment/limit, and incorporates these factors into our risk management strategies  They are also used to determine levels of reinsurance and capital requirements to mete claims needs, pricing adequacy for catastrophic costs and to set guidelines to mitigate catastrophe exposures

Most catastrophe models today are approved by regulators and are generally developed using the latest weather and climate data and science, tested by metrological, engineering, computer science and actuarial experts  The models often create alterations that account for perils where they believe future losses may deviate substantially from historical trends, specifically for Hurricanes  In these cases, Bankers considers the potential impact on the catastrophe loss distributions shown by these models

Furthermore, Bankers also takes into consideration different assumptions of Hurricane frequency and severity to match both the historic and the potential future hazard trends to test the impact of climate change on loss distribution  In addition to assumption sets created by model vendors, Bankers models scenarios of past severe events to determine the impact of prior storms on the current portfolio  Finally, Bankers considers deterministic scenarios to identify the potential impact of a worst-case scenario across its portfolio  The results of these stress tests are evaluated when deciding the best risk management strategy for the company, reinsurance purchases and growth plans and projections

" The new Centene Clayton campus under construction is striving to achieve the greatest energy efficiency and resulting emissions reduction while respecting local market forces and LEED program commitments The project team has committed to achieve LEED Gold certification for the new campus office buildings 

Our Missouri data center has been built to LEED specifications Our secondary data center, located in California, meets the states Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards Additionally, all our data centers utilize cooling capabilities in order to minimize our power consumption at those sites 

The new campus is also mitigating some of the local effects of climate change by integrating over 26,000 sf of green roof area This serves both to reduce the amount of storm water flow that could contribute to local flooding as well as reducing potential increases to storm energy/intensity due to urban heat island effect through the integration of cool roof strategies In addition to these strategies, the new Centene campus will have greater emergency generator capacity than required by code to ensure safety of building occupancy and greater continuity of building operations during emergency situations

Our Missouri data center has been built to LEED specifications Our secondary data center, located in California, meets the state's Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards Additionally, all our data centers utilize cooling capabilities in order to minimize our power consumption at those sites
The new campus is also mitigating some of the local effects of climate change by integrating over 26,000 sf of green roof area This serves both to reduce the amount of storm water flow that could contribute to local flooding as well as reducing potential increases to storm energy/intensity due to urban heat island effect through the integration of cool roof strategies In addition to these strategies, the new Centene campus will have greater emergency generator capacity than required by code to ensure safety of building occupancy and greater continuity of building operations during emergency situations

"  If this were to happen, it could lead to increased incidences of chronic illnesses and in the type of clinical services Humana will need to offer its members For example, ""The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment"" published by the US Global Change Research Program notes that climate change is already resulting in significant public health impacts which will continue to worsen if greenhouse gas emissions are not addressed

If Humana did not prepare for changes in physical climate, it is possible that Humana could suffer a loss in market share due to lack of readiness as well as increased operational costs associated with more health-related claims being filed  It is difficult to assess the financial impacts of these risks given the complexity of climate change and population health, however we do not currently anticipate substantial bottom line impacts

Climate change risks may also affect Humanas premium pricing, and therefore projected revenues associated with our services  Pricing and revenues are sensitive to several factors that may be impacted by climate change, including catastrophes or extreme weather events including public health epidemics or severe weather (eg hurricanes)  We continually review estimates of future payments relating to benefit claims costs for services incurred and make necessary adjustments to our reserves, including premium deficiency reserves where appropriate However, these estimates involve extensive judgment, and have considerable inherent variability that is sensitive to claim payment patterns and medical cost trends Senior level management will review pertinent information and have the ultimate authority to recommend changes in services offered and cost structures related to shifts in claims filed, or other company procedures in order to reduce impacts from these changes in customer claims and health trends related to changes in climate  The results of our partner dialogues and regional trending will inform future decisions around services offered to mitigate these impacts




Risks driven by changes in regulation

The financial risks resulting from an increase in operational and capital costs due to climate change-related regulations are considered to have a low magnitude of impact because energy expenditures represent less than 01% of Humanas total operating budget Though operating expense increases due to energy taxes and regulations would have a material impact on budgetary costs, the overall operational cost impact for the portfolio would be minimal

Humana's Workplace Solutions team continuously evaluates short term and long term regulatory risks around energy and carbon A combination of forecasted energy costs due to general commodity price pressures, taxes and regulations or other impact is evaluated by the team to manage evolving financial exposure to energy prices In order to curb projected increases, the team works to budget for cost and environmental impact mitigation efforts such as energy efficiency projects to manage this risk This resulted in the formulation of an aggressive energy and carbon reduction target for the portfolio in efforts to manage operating costs and reduce Humana's environmental impacts

Risks driven by changes in physical climate parameters 

Increases in average temperature could result in more cooling degree days for Humana's data centers which could increase cooling loads at these and other locations

Any rise in average temperature that results in more cooling degree days throughout the year could increase cooling costs at Humana facilities, and in particular the company's data centers  Based on peer-reviewed research published in 2014, Humana has estimated the cost implications of rising data center energy consumption due to an increase in cooling degree days The potential aggregate estimated cost increase from 2015-2030 is $668,000, which is less than 01% of Humanas $7,381 million operating costs in 2019

Humana has worked with its equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and is implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of its data center equipment  For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center

While Humana does not have a direct cost associated with managing cooling degree days, past and ongoing investment in data center energy efficiency mitigates the risk by reducing overall energy consumption For example, Humana continues to use modeling software and tools purchased prior to the reporting period to optimize air flow and cooling needs In 2018, the hardware for the Tridium BMS system cost $25,000, while in 2019, the installation of two HVAC upgrade projects at our Louisville and Simpsonville Data Center locations cost $910,000; funding came from the HUM Workplace Solutions Facilities Management team capital budget and the Facilities Management vendor managed the work

Significant weather events could also negatively impact our business by disrupting regular operations and limiting accessibility for our associates as well as our members Our Florida, Puerto Rico, and Texas operations in particular are located in areas that often experience severe storms As our data centers have disaster recovery methods in place to manage for risks unrelated to climate change, the estimated financial implications of this type of service disruption are considered to be low We relocated our recovery systems to Kentucky as a direct result of the lessons learned from Hurricane Maria, supporting our efforts to mitigate against hurricanes and other weather events, for which the financial implications are difficult to assess

To decrease the potential of business interruption due to a significant weather event, Humana's data centers maintain two separate power inputs, from different grids The centers also maintain a robust generator system that can provide power for 3-5 days before requiring re-fueling, while fuel service is contracted for a priority refill if requested Dual cooling systems are also in place Data center exterior walls were built to exceed ""tornado-level"" winds of over 100 mph, and both data centers are built on land not susceptible to flooding Humana maintains a secondary data center to support disaster recovery of technical systems In addition to our facility-specific management methods, Humana also has a robust work at home program, allowing staff to work remotely should there be an instance of reduced accessibility/pandemic or other issue A dedicated tool to track events is used to manage our response and communications, providing us with a readily available resource to understand any lessons learned

The management methods described, including the data center specifications, our Business Continuity Program, and our work at home program, and are considered to be routine operations for Humana to manage for several risks and opportunities in addition to the potential effects of climate change

Berkley Life and Health Insurance Company (Berkley Life) is a niche insurer writing health insurance that responds to major medical issues  Historically we have not experienced any increase in losses as a result of natural catastrophes such as hurricane, flood or tornado, nor do we currently anticipate this to occur in the future  Neither the management of Berkley Life nor the Berkley Group ERM team has identified any link between loss frequency and / or severity in the major medical health insurance written by Berkley Life and natural catastrophes such as hurricane, tornado, flood, drought or wildfire  Consequently although Berkley Life has full access to the Berkley Groups research into the potential impact of climate change, it is not currently an issue for Berkley Life from an insured loss perspective

Yes, the Companies do the following:  
Recycling: Our Companies participate in programs that encourage the recycling of paper, bottles and cans, as well as cardboards and plastics Document destruction bins and a pick-up service are used by multiple offices within the Companies that allow for proper destruction of paper files This service picks up, shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment  The Companies continually strives to promote a greener environment by converting to paperless as much as possible and imaging paper files into electronic documents One of the office locations reminds email recipients under the signature line of their email to consider the environment before printing to conserve paper Email and phone communication, both with internal and external customers (namely policyholders) is encouraged to reduce the Companies carbon footprint and cut down on printed hard copy communications Whiteboards and digital projectors are also installed in meeting rooms so that the amount of paper consumed is reduced 
One example of the Companies demonstrating their care for the environment occurred when their office building was under construction Instead of purchasing brand new fixtures and furnishings, they reused some materials such as doors, window treatments, light fixtures and ceiling grid from the previous building to save on cost and to reduce the amount of waste that they were putting in the landfill As far as cleaning materials for our offices buildings are concerned, the selection of cleaning materials within some of the locations is carefully considered and a large portion of the cleaning products used in certain offices are either environmentally safe cleaning products and/or are white vinegar based 
Water & Conservation: Companies closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some to an extent that sensors determine whether or not the grounds actually need water based on the amount of rainfall that the area has seen Others are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to provide for a more predictable monthly water bill In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, certain buildings have a reverse osmosis system installed that provides filtered water to employees and is intended to promote the use of thermos/hard plastic water bottles and cut down on the amount of trash/recycling One of the Companies has low consumption water closets installed in all of the bathrooms to further reduce the amount of water used
Lighting: Some Company buildings are currently in process of or already are Energy Star Rated Some have converted incandescent lighting to fluorescent, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations is set for regularly scheduled business hours and is of limited use on nights and weekends Parking garage lighting is also set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day, rather than continuously In addition, employees are encouraged to turn lights off in areas not in use and reminders are placed in those areas to encourage employees to conserve energy when possible In some offices, motion activated sensors have been installed for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used 
Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back at night and during non-business hours to conserve energy usage when employees are not there When employees are in the building, heat and cooling system temperatures are closely monitored using a computerized environment with limited access, and systems run only when necessary rather than continuously On nights and weekends, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system Having areas on a timer system eliminates the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy (this includes regular changing of air filters, etc) Some offices either have or are in the process of replacing older heat pumps with newer, more energy efficient units 
Technology: Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication iPads are available to some employees at a few of the offices that help to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies IT, at one location, is in process of enhancing their technology by converting computer monitors from LCD to LED and replacing older computer systems with more up to date, energy efficient models In addition, at one location plans are in place to convert the server room to a more energy efficient area that would promote less usage of cooling systems One office has installed power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Some employees have the capability to access the office remotely to curtail transportation to and from the office Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics 
Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a few of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles In addition, telecommuting is available to some departments, which allows for individuals to remote in and work from their home, saving fuel and reducing the emissions released into the air A few of the office locations have company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg Other offices are located in areas where most staff use public transport to get to work, rather than driving personal vehicles If using public transit to get to and from work, one office offers an employer sponsored public transit pass system to encourage continued use of public transportation One Company went so far as to relocate a satellite office that cut down travel time significantly for employees Others offer flexible work hours so that employees may take advantage of the opportunity to avoid high traffic time when commuting to and from work

" Through MetLifes Sustainability Program, the Company strives to lower energy consumption, mitigate GHG emissions and reduce the overall environmental impact of its global operations  The Companys environmental management efforts include awareness and education aimed to facilitate waste reduction, recycling and reuse initiatives; engage employees on environmental issues and healthy lifestyle choices; and work with suppliers to reduce environmental impacts

MetLifes GHG emissions reduction strategy is focused on energy efficiency and green energy purchasing for US owned-and-operated office facilities, as the Company achieves emissions reductions in other areas of its carbon footprint In 2005, MetLife established a goal to reduce indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 emissions) 20% by 2010 (based on the 2005 baseline year) for all of the Companys US owned-and-operated office facilities This goal was achieved in 2009 Since then, MetLifes portfolio has annually achieved a total of zero Scope 2 emissions through renewable energy credit (REC) purchases As of end of the year 2014, MetLife has reduced energy consumption by 25% for the same portfolio of offices, as compared to the baseline year The energy reduction was realized through a combination of capital projects and facility upgrades focused on energy efficient Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment, lighting, commissioning, water efficiency, and demand metering Continuing this significant progress, MetLife looks for new opportunities to reduce the Companys carbon footprint, address climate change, and invest in efforts that have a positive impact on the environment  In 2014, MetLife established two new public emissions reduction targets for the Companys US owned-and-operated office facilities: a 10% reduction in energy (kWh) consumption by the end of 2017 relative to a 2010 baseline year and continued achievement of zero Scope 2 GHG emissions annually, through the Companys REC purchasing strategies 

MetLife embeds environmental sustainability and emissions reduction programs into the Companys overall business strategy through green procurement practices and environmental certifications (eg, Energy Star, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) etc) Recent initiatives include MetLifes participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Program, aimed at benchmarking and reducing value chain emissions MetLife also maintains focus on improving energy efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the Companys data center operations In 2012, MetLifes Rensselaer Information Systems Center (RISC) data center in Troy, New York, was recognized as the first Energy Star-certified data center in New York State In 2014, the RISC the data center scored in the 98th percentile of existing building data centers As of 2015 there are fewer than 40 data centers with the Energy Star label and MetLife has one of the highest ranked data centers in the nation Efforts implemented to reduce RISCs environmental impacts included: installation of boiler system controls; upgraded lighting control panels; utilization of waterless technology; and implementation of virtualization technology to enable the facility to share resources and save energy, hardware, software licensing, and IT infrastructure maintenance costs

We consider a range of potential opportunities driven by physical climate risks, including changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns and sea levels Specifically, we consider the potential for changes in physical climate parameters to present a broader series of global public health challenges, such as those relating to (1) extreme weather events, (2) decreases in water supply, (3) heat exposure and (4) declining crop yields In the short-term, extreme weather events have been prioritized as our greatest physical risk

We also consider how changes in physical and transition risks could also influence a series of socioeconomic challenges and opportunities that would likely impact the delivery of healthcare Examples could include health and hygiene issues due to migration, malnutrition, and increases in respiratory, bronchial, water-borne and other diseases Additionally, we consider how these negative societal and environmental impacts could present opportunities where Cigna, in particular, could provide products and services to help respond to these changes in physical climate parameters across the markets we serve

Our risk assessment considers all geographic locations and markets where we operate in addition to potential new markets under evaluation Additionally, we consider global environmental and socioeconomic trends, which may impact the value of our assets in addition to revenue and costs in our target markets The criteria used to determine our priorities with regards to climate change risks and opportunities include the following factors: degree of potential regulatory, physical and other business impacts to Cigna In addition to engaging with our internal stakeholders to prioritize risks and opportunities, we also monitor the activities related to climate change risk among our key stakeholders, which include investors, corporate customers and industry peers 

For example, increasing energy efficiency at our facilities has been prioritized due to (1) cost savings and risk mitigation opportunities, (2) identified value to our stakeholders and (3) alignment with our mission and the increasingly globalized nature of our operations Based on our prioritization, we have a Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan in place that includes formal policies on energy and water consumption, and direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions

We define risk as having a substantial financial and strategic impact using both qualitative and quantitative measures Qualitative measures consider correlations to our business model, mission 
and value chain Quantitatively, we generally consider a risk to be substantive based on a scenario where at least 1% of our net income could be impacted In 2018, this threshold was approximately $25 million

In responding, State Farm has utilized the definition of impact of climate change risk developed for the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook which is
the impact of climate change risk may be identified as any significant change in the measures of climate over an extended period of time that includes major changes in relative temperatures, precipitation, or wind patterns that occur over several decades or longer It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)
Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1982 - 2016, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 20%, with six of the largest ten non-hurricane catastrophe years occurring in the last ten  years after adjusting for policy growth and inflation  This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the coastal regions, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change 

With respect to evaluating climate change risk, various units of the company(s) handle separate general functions, such as underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through the Enterprise Risk Management process   Within each function, there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels  Each function team is evaluating and determining how best to approach the evaluation, for example, multiple models are used to underwrite certain exposures, including those based on historical data and others on changing weather patterns  In these efforts to evaluate and model weather related effects State Farm is continuously investing in the latest tools and improving techniques to model severe weather in order to accurately measure risk to better match risk to price of the various products  

No - The company does not have a climate change policy with respect to investment management
Risks associated with State Farms investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farms financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders  While State Farm does not have a specific policy addressing climate change measures as they relate to potential risks to investments, investment analysis incorporates relevant risk factors into the decision making process, including impact on weather patterns and the innovation necessary to  produce reliable energy while lowering the carbon footprint  
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding  Restrictions on investments in unregulated energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry  Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are directly considered when evaluating investments in municipalities  In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification  We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy  Additionally, we provide financing to entities that support green efforts as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies

"I has updated its corporate sustainability plan to a corporate responsibility plan The plan includes a vision, mission and focus areas  The focus areas include community, environment and people and detail American Familys commitment to protecting what matters most through positive social and environmental impact with measurable benefits for customers and their communities, employees and our agents  In 2018, American Family released its first Corporate Responsibility Report summarizing our efforts for 2017, https://wwwamfamcom/about/corporate-responsibility The 2018 Corporate Responsibility report will be released in August 2019   
The activities of the American Family corporate responsibility plan align directly with our companys strategic plan through customer focused environmental sustainability efforts like reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our operations Other initiatives under the environment pillar include reducing water consumption, reducing waste, reducing impact on the land and reducing impact on food service American Family supports environmentally conscious employees by supplying electric vehicle charging stations throughout its parking structures at its main campus and two regional offices The EV charging stations are available for use by any employees with all electric or plug in hybrid vehicles at no cost to employees
One of the objectives under the environment pillar of the corporate responsibility plan is reducing greenhouse gas emissions A primary strategy for this is the development of the 2019 American Family Insurance (AFI) Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy The strategy will utilize operational carbon/GHG data to inform a path toward NetZero and provide the foundation from which future capital and operational expenses can be prioritized The Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy will serve as the primary guide for short term environmental action over the next five years  with medium and long term goals outlined AFI also has an energy management strategy with the goal of continuously improving efficiency across owned facilities The strategy is managed by a cross-disciplinary team that includes representation from Facilities, Information Services and Data Center Management It includes rigorous efficiency and emission targets out to 2025 with a continuous improvement cycle for strategic planning updates annually Measurement towards these goals has been in place since 2008, when the company established an energy management baseline In 2007, the company completed a third party-reviewed greenhouse gas emissions inventory Owned real estate is actively maintained with the Energy Star portfolio and includes multiple certifications In 2012, variable frequency drives were installed in both data centers and non-data air conditioning centers to reduce energy use  Solar panels have been installed in five locations for a total of 220kW of renewable power generated on site  The company now has 2 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified facilities in its portfolio (Eden Prairie, MN and Madison, WI) with a 3rd currently LEED registered facility in Madison, WI Complementary programs include building envelope upgrades, green roofs, HVAC fixtures and controls, retro-commissioning projects, electrical fixture and controls updates, back up generation and behavioral modifications such as employee programs to power down equipment when it is not in use To date, these efforts combined have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 51,716 metric tons

American Familys latest construction project, the Spark complex on Madisons east side, received the IBHS Fortified GOLD Commercial High Wind and Hail certification in April of 2019 It was the first commercial building in the country to receive this designation The structure was designed and built not only to be sustainable, but it was also built to some of the most stringent standards of resiliency known The structure itself was designed to be strong, safe for occupants and if necessary, has its own back-up power and HVAC systems so that it can remain operational even if the infrastructure fails 

American Family also supports transportation alternatives such as reducing the impact of business travel and employee commuting through increased use of webcasts and videoconferencing Since 2006, video conferencing systems and other telepresence technology have provided virtual communications alternatives to reduce travel In 2013, trailer skirts were installed on the over the road trailer, resulting in an annual 3 percent reduction in fuel use and an annual reduction of  2,400 metric tons of CO2 emissions In April 2012, The League of American Bicyclists designated American Family Insurances Madison, WI, headquarters as a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Business (BFB), based on best practices for staff and the greater community 
A zero waste initiative was launched in 2011 A Zero Waste Strategy is being developed for multiple waste streams across the enterprise A myriad of programs have been put into place towards achieving a 90 percent waste diversion goal including the direct diversion of construction and demolition waste, pre-consumer and post-consumer organic waste, office paper recycling and electronic waste recycling Reductions in the consumption of paper and office supplies have also been achieved In 2018, the company diverted 110 tons of organic waste from the landfill  Beginning in 2013, 40 percent of our customer-facing correspondence is sourced from 30 percent and 10 percent post-consumer content, saving an estimated 440 metric tons of CO2 at current volumes Since 2010 we have had a gently used office supply program as a default for employees 

"	0	"I has updated its corporate sustainability plan to a corporate responsibility plan The plan includes a vision, mission and focus areas The focus areas include community, environment and people and detail American Family's commitment to protecting what matters most through positive social and environmental impact with measurable benefits for customers and their communities, employees and our agents In 2018, American Family released its first Corporate Responsibility Report summarizing our efforts for 2017, https://wwwamfamcom/about/corporate-responsibility The 2018 Corporate Responsibility report will be released in August 2019
The activities of the American Family corporate responsibility plan align directly with our company's strategic plan through customer focused environmental sustainability efforts like reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our operations Other initiatives under the environment pillar include reducing water consumption, reducing waste, reducing impact on the land and reducing impact on food service American Family supports environmentally conscious employees by supplying electric vehicle charging stations throughout its parking structures at its main campus and two regional offices The EV charging stations are available for use by any employees with all electric or plug in hybrid vehicles at no cost to employees
One of the objectives under the environment pillar of the corporate responsibility plan is reducing greenhouse gas emissions A primary strategy for this is the development of the 2019 American Family Insurance (AFI) Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy The strategy will utilize operational carbon/GHG data to inform a path toward NetZero and provide the foundation from which future capital and operational expenses can be prioritized The Sustainability and Climate Action Strategy will serve as the primary guide for short term environmental action over the next five years - with medium and long term goals outlined AFI also has an energy management strategy with the goal of continuously improving efficiency across owned facilities The strategy is managed by a cross-disciplinary team that includes representation from Facilities, Information Services and Data Center Management It includes rigorous efficiency and emission targets out to 2025 with a continuous improvement cycle for strategic planning updates annually Measurement towards these goals has been in place since 2008, when the company established an energy management baseline In 2007, the company completed a third party-reviewed greenhouse gas emissions inventory Owned real estate is actively maintained with the Energy Star portfolio and includes multiple certifications In 2012, variable frequency drives were installed in both data centers and non-data air conditioning centers to reduce energy use Solar panels have been installed in five locations for a total of 220kW of renewable power generated on site The company now has 2 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified facilities in its portfolio (Eden Prairie, MN and Madison, WI) with a 3rd currently LEED registered facility in Madison, WI Complementary programs include building envelope upgrades, green roofs, HVAC fixtures and controls, retro-commissioning projects, electrical fixture and controls updates, back up generation and behavioral modifications such as employee programs to power down equipment when it is not in use To date, these efforts combined have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 51,716 metric tons

" A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified  amount;  secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our supply chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases In 2017, total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) decreased by 56% and were thus 19% lower than in 2013 We achieved this reduction mainly by switching to renewable power in some of our Asian locations by further cutting our energy intensity, eg through more efficient heating Swiss Re has implemented a number of projects that reduce our environmental footprint:

	First, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee, ie to reduce our energy intensity In the first phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme, we set ourselves a 20% reduction target compared with 2003 levels, measured in kWh per employee Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating backoffice tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we actually achieved a reduction of 465% by 2013 For the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme (base year 2013), our commitment is to continuously reduce energy intensity by 2% per year As a matter of fact, our energy intensity was 243% lower at the end of 2017 than in 2013 Partly, we achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones In 2017 we completed Swiss Re Next at the Group's headquarters in Zurich which replaced the decommissioned Neubau building
	Second, going one step further, we have recently started to build our own solar power facilities Following earlier projects in Italy, Switzerland and the UK, we launched in 2016 a large facility at our Armonk Americas headquarters Comprising ten acres of ground-mounted panels, the facility has a capacity of two megawatts, sufficient to supply more than 60% of the sites power requirements 

	Third, whenever possible, we purchase power from renewable sources This has been a key measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme After starting to use renewable power at four European locations in 2005, we set ourselves the goal of using 100% renewable power at all locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality by the end of 2013 Based on our quality assessments of available energy sources, we believe we reached this goal and used 100% renewable power at 25 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania as per the end of 2013 At the end of 2017, approximately 84% of the power we purchased across the Group came from renewable energy sources We are committed to raising this figure to 100% 
	Fourth, as a result of the substantial cuts we have achieved in CO2 emissions from power consumption and heating since 2003, business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today We continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally We have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips: (1) We have built up a dense network of video conferencing equipment across the Group Recently, we partly replaced these facilities with state-of-the-art video presence technology, which creates a real-time, life-size virtual meeting experience in specially designed rooms By the end of 2017, we had a total of 170 video presence facilities worldwide (2) Furthermore, we introduced an internal carbon levy on air travel in 2014, which uses the polluter pays principle It allocates the costs of the Voluntary Emissions Reductions (VERs) that we need to buy to offset our CO2 emissions to the Groups Global Functions in proportion to their respective share of air travel (previously they had been borne centrally by Group Finance) This internal price on carbon heightens awareness of travel costs among our managers and employees and creates a further incentive to reduce air travel, in addition to flight costs Despite these measures, the amount of kilometres travelled per employee and the associated emissions rose in past years A key driver is our continued expansion in high growth markets, which has brought an increase in teams distributed across different locations In 2017, the total distance each of our employees travelled has stabilized and on average increased by just 04% compared with previous year
	Fifth, the second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered in the second phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme, we bought and retired VERs for a total of 80,780 tonnes of CO2 in 2016 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard Therefore, we have developed a set of criteria to select projects that generate certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side-effects and benefit the poorest regions

"  However, Homesite does encourage policyholders to prevent or mitigate losses caused by covered perils, whether or not the losses could be attributed to climate change  This includes offering mitigation discounts in some states to customers that make use of storm shutters or other construction features to reduce the risk of loss due to hurricane  For customers in areas prone to hurricanes and wildfires, Homesite sends informational emails and tweets that outline methods home owners can adopt to increase the durability and safety of homes to natural perils at the start of the season as well as several times during the season  In addition, Homesite posts similar informational articles on its website  At the time of major weather events, most often hurricanes, Homesite will contact customers by e-mail and phone to warn of the event and provide safety tips for protecting life and property during the event

Homesite is a member of the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS)  The following text, prepared by IBHS, is a brief description of the Institute and some of its activities that relate to the issue of climate change
IBHS is a 501(c)(3) organization, wholly supported by the property (re)insurance industry, which conducts objective, scientific research to identify and promote effective actions that strengthen homes, businesses and communities against natural disasters and other causes of loss IBHS does this by identifying and advocating improved property design, construction, retrofitting, maintenance, repair, and preparation practices  IBHS guidance for mitigating property losses is available directly to the public and to our members/policyholders, at wwwdisastersafetyorg, and through social media (eg, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Vimeo)
IBHS advocates the concept of going green and building strong recognizing that addressing climate change involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting homes, businesses, and communities to severe weather that may result from climate change:
	As an insurance-supported organization, IBHS recognizes that climate change strategies must do more than build structures to be energy efficient  They must be built to modern fire protection standards to help resist fire and avoid the water/chemical deluge needed for fire suppression; they should be strong enough to avoid wind destruction and resulting relocation in landfills; and properties should be sited and elevated in a manner that protects against flooding and environmental degradation from landslides  All of these are part of going green
	IBHS also firmly believes that adaptation is critical, not only to reduce long-term property insurance losses, but to buttress individual and societal resilience  All of the property protection measures that IBHS advocates to strengthen structures against current weather threats will also reduce future losses caused by climate change events  And, the unprecedented scientific research conducted at the unique IBHS Research Center is critical to identification of new mitigation actions that may help protect against more severe weather events
	Additionally, research conducted by IBHS will help to make sure that green building enhancements do not inadvertently cause structures to be less disaster-resistant, or even worse, threaten the life safety of occupants or first respondersfor example, photovoltaic arrays that take flight or pose fire suppression challenges are the antithesis of building strong  

As a building science institute, and due to antitrust concerns, IBHS does not have access to, and cannot compile, a list of market-based discounts offered by specific insurers with respect to current or future weather scenarios  That said, IBHS research helps its member companies to better understand structural vulnerability and the role that mitigation plays in reducing damage from severe weather, as well as what mitigation features to look for when inspecting a residential or commercial building
   
A few states (incl Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina) have developed legislative or regulatory discount frameworks for homes built or retrofitted to the code-plus, hazard-specific FORTIFIED new construction and retrofit standards developed by IBHS  In these states, the Institute has worked with insurance regulators and insurance companies to make sure that the discount programs work as they were intended upon enactment, and actually facilitate risk-based pricing, which can serve both to encourage effective mitigation and discourage unsound development in disaster-prone areas 

In 2014, our parent American Family, partnered with IBHS through a first-of-its-kind national study that will support researchers over the next 25 years in making residential roofs last longer and leak less often ultimately helping customers mitigate risks The study will determine how Midwest weather affects different brands of roofing material, using a dozen small roof structures built on a bare patch of ground at American Familys corporate headquarters

TMH has established a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Division that promotes environmental management throughout the Group In addition, key persons have been assigned to roles promoting CSR activities throughout the world Such activities include reducing environmental impact in business activities and efforts to protect the environment in local communities and society

A number of initiatives have been developed to achieve carbon neutral status including:
 Promoting Environmental Management Systems and employee participation through the 3Rs
(Reduce, Reuse, Recycle);
 The Green Gift Project which includes mangrove planting and other environmental protection activities worldwide which contribute not only to the alleviation of and adaptation to climate change and protection of biodiversity but also the reduction in disaster damage and stability in the lives of people in designated planting regions The Mangrove Planting Project has been in place since 1999 and since that time, in excess of 9,500 hectares of mangrove forest have been planted in nine countries: Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Fiji, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia;
 PHLY 80K Trees, a tree planting program inspired by the Green Gift Project, which began in 2015 The PHLY 80K Trees goal was reached with the help of Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PIC) independent agents, brokers and policyholders and was renewed for the second year in 2016 PIC invited producers and policyholders to enroll in paperless statements The cost savings to PIC partially funded the planting of 80,000 trees Employees also raised money to support the initiative and in 2016, about 50 employees assisted with planting a portion of the 80,000 trees;
 GREENPHLY, a PIC employee-driven environmental awareness program which involves support of environmental protection activities by individuals and communities and efforts to reduce the environmental load in our offices through minimizing the environmental burden in our business activities

The Tokio Marine Group has adopted the following practices to assess and reduce or mitigate emissions in the organizations:  Going paperless and/or reducing paper consumption Many offices have switched to printer paper made from recycled content for use when printing is necessary  Purchasing office supplies that are made from green or recycled materials  Transitioning from water bottle coolers to more energy efficient, bottle-less water cooler systems and utilizing reusable bottles in place of plastic water bottles or styrofoam cups  Replacing personal printers with shared, more energy-efficient multifunctional devices  Redesigning workstations to reduce energy costs  Establishing recycling programs for paper, plastic, light bulbs, toner and ink cartridges and cans and bottles at offices nationwide Encouraging carpooling, vanpooling and other ride share options as well as the use of public transportation  Encouraging bike to work programs  Replacing face-to-face meetings by using video conference equipment, WebEx and other technologies  Participation in TMHs 100 year commitment to the re-forestation of the mangrove trees by having employees take part in planting mangrove trees on plantations in Southeast Asia  Becoming LEED certified in some locations  Utilizing timers on lights to reduce energy consumption The Tokio Marine Group has also taken steps to increase environmental education and awareness among its employees Community outreach events are regularly organized to demonstrate the Tokio Marine Groups commitment to reducing environmental impact Initiatives included:  Lunch-and-Learn Events:
Representatives from local environmental non-profits invited to speak to employees about areas of environmental concern such as storm water management, clean air and pollution and energy conservation  Employee Volunteer Events: A number of company-sponsored environmental volunteer events have been conducted Since 2012, the Tokio Marine Group has had an environmental corporate social responsibility coordinator on staff  PIC established GreenPHLY, a team effort by employees to preserve the environment and mitigate the carbon footprint PIC developed the GreenPHLY Environmental Priority Action Plan which established the companys environmental goals and objectives for the future The plan is focused on three (3) environmental priority areas including carbon footprint reduction, environmental education and awareness and community outreach In support of carbon footprint reduction, carbon emissions, as measured by energy usage and paper consumption, are tracked using the Hara environment management system software PIC has purchased green power equivalent to 100% of the companys electricity use in its offices nationwide since 2013 The purchase of certified, 100% wind generated renewable energy certificates in 2016 displaced 3,2404 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 684 cars off the road for a year

This green power purchase enabled PIC to join the EPAs Green Power Partnership (GPP) and Leadership Club The GPP assists organizations in procuring electricity generated from renewable sources and recognizes Partners green power leadership In 2014, PIC was awarded a US EPA Green Power Leadership Award for Green Power Purchasing In 2015, PIC launched a campaign in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation to replant trees in forests nationwide that have been devastated by wildfires In 2015, PIC launched a campaign in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation to replant trees in forests nationwide that have been devastated by wildfires Since 2015, PIC has funded the planting of 160,000 trees and has renewed this commitment for the 2017- 2018 planting season to plant an additional 80,000 trees

MassMutual considers a wide variety of risks in analysis of current and potential investments Business and operating practices - including environmental, social, and corporate governance policies - are evaluated in this context as appropriate and may influence decisions Further, research analysts and portfolio managers in the asset management subsidiaries have a fiduciary obligation to evaluate many factors in determining their opinion(s) on the available investment opportunities While MassMutual does not currently have a specific climate change policy related to risk and investment management, climate change is one of many risks considered in analysis of current and potential investments With respect to its real estate investments, Cornerstone, a real estate advisory firm and member of the MassMutual Financial Group, was named a Premier Member of Energy Star Certification in 2015:
o 50 Energy Star certified buildings (68% of Cornerstone's office portfolio)
o 14 office buildings either earned or currently earning LEED Certification
Since 2013, Cornerstone has been an Energy Star Leader recipient for leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by achieving the ""Top Overall Energy Performance"" milestone across all of its investment properties Cornerstone performs a Property Condition Assessment and Phase I Environmental Audit for each of its real estate acquisitions, whether for MassMutual or its other clients The scope of the due diligence includes a comprehensive assessment of the following risks: physical plant, code compliance, seismic, energy performance, flood plain, wind, storm surge, and pollution Specialty consultants are engaged to assist in the review process The physical due diligence, including the calculation of the replacement value, supports the insurance underwriting relative to flood, wind, storm surge and seismic risk The company reviews energy use to determine the property's energy performance and carbon footprint utilizing the Energy Star rating system to determine the property's energy efficiency and ranking among its peers Energy conservation opportunities are identified and documented to assist with the further reduction of energy use and carbon footprint

engage with policy makers at international and national levels, business leaders in the
insurance industry and other sectors, multilateral organizations, NGOs, and others One of
our main engagement activities in recent years relates to the annual United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) international climate negotiations
The engagement process comprises of a mixture of targeted and ad hoc actions often
carried out as an individual company but also through work with other organizations like
climate focused NGOs, and both international and US based platforms, such as the World
Economic Forum and Clinton Global Initiative In 2012 and 2013 Swiss Re worked closely
with the US-based NGO Ceres on an initiative assessing urban resilience to climate change
in the US This process has brought together insurance companies as well as city officials, property owners and academics to look for new approaches to this issue as well as how best to bring insurance industry expertise into the topic area Swiss Re also works closely with The Climate Group particularly in the US (NGO, focus: emissions reductions and the clean energy revolution) and is the founding sponsor of The Climate Group's ""Climate Week NYC"" (2009 - 2014), Oxfam America (NGO, focus: climate adaptation, integration of risk management/transfer into development projects, development of new insurance markets to tackle climate risks being faced by the most vulnerable communities) and ClimateWise (insurance industry initiative, focus: widening the commitment to a set of insurance sector related climate principles) The main topics of Swiss Re's engagement include:

- the need for a legislative response to ensure that appropriate action is taken to tackle
man-made greenhouse gas emissions;
- the need to adapt to the impacts of climate change to make society more resilient to
severe weather and the integration of climate risk consideration into the decisionmaking
process of both public and private sectors;
- the promotion of understanding that climate change can best be dealt with if it is
recognized as both a risk and opportunity;
- the development of new insurance products and services to contribute to the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions as well as helping to manage the physical impacts of
climate risk

One of the initiatives launched by Swiss Re as part of it 150th Anniversary program is the
microsite blog ""Open Minds"" It is designed as a dialogue platform and a place to exchange
views on risks, with a focus on the risks well face in the future Alongside our clients and employees, citizens, organizations, and governments are invited to discuss how we can
come together to help find answers to some of the worlds biggest challenges Three of the
four featured topics are climate related: climate and disasters, sustainable energy, food
security

Swiss Re uses its research as a basis for engagement with policymakers and other decision
makers For example, the company's Economics of Climate Adaptation research series has
been discussed widely (eg a briefing session on this study, and insurance products to
manage climate risk, was held for various Ambassadors based in Switzerland at Swiss Re's
Centre for Global Dialogue) Other events have been held/attended presenting this topic in
various countries, including the US, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia, Canada, France and
Austria As part of the management of the climate topic, our Sustainability & Political Risk Management unit consistently identifies and evaluates opportunities to engage on the
issue This involves proactively searching for, and reactively assessing, opportunities to
address our key stakeholders on climate change This can take the form of speaking
engagements, publications, media interviews, media articles, and others We also
encourage our employees to increase their awareness of the issues presented by climate
change This can take the form of informal ""Lunch & Learn"" sessions, ""Energy Fairs"" that are held for employees at the main US, European and Asian locations to provide information and advice on climate and other environmental topics, communications on the company's internal website, or incentive schemes such as our COYou2 Reduce & Gain
programme which offers financial subsidies for the purchase of low carbon technology such
as hybrid cars and energy efficient appliances Additionally, the ""Own the Way You Work""
initiative is a Swiss Re effort to provide further workplace flexibility which will reduce
emissions from commuting

Swiss Re partners with various public and private sector stakeholders, including leading
universities, NGOs, and academic institutions to advance knowledge on the risks of climate
change Swiss Re regularly publishes a wide array of other reports related to the climate
topic from both US-centric and international perspectives:

To educate the public and industry alike about the increased risk of natural catastrophes
posed by climate change, Swiss Re released its Flood Risk App in August, 2012
(http://wwwswissrecom/library/Apps/The_Flood_App_for_iPadhtml), available for free on
the iTunes App Store The Flood Risk App gives a general understanding of flood risks and
explains how to manage and insure these risks The App explores different types of flooding
and the challenges involved in making floods insurable It highlights the importance of
adapting to climate change and shows how reliable flood information can strengthen flood
preparedness The app was upgraded to provide an interactive demonstration of resilience

" In selecting and monitoring investments, MetLife employs careful and comprehensive processes that include consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors As stated above, climate risk is one of the many risks considered, as applicable, under the Companys general policy on managing investment risk 

MREI embraces its role as a responsible real estate investor and is committed to preserving the environment through implementation of effective energy and natural resource management programs and increased investment in sustainable properties We understand the impact buildings have on people, communities and the environment  We also understand that issues such as global climate change and resource limitations, combined with tenant demands for improved environmental performance and operational efficiencies, will continue to have a significant impact on investment decisions and financial performance MREI monitors its exposure to earthquake and windstorms risk based on geographic concentrations on a semiannual basis  

MREI has a broad based energy and sustainability strategy centered on Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program and US Green Building Council's LEED standards Our objective is to increase the efficiency and sustainability of MREIs real estate portfolio, to improve the portfolios operational and financial performance, and increase value through a leadership role in green building initiatives As of December 31, 2014, MetLife has an equity stake in 46 LEED-certified properties  More importantly, MetLife strives to embed energy and sustainability considerations into all of its investment decisions and in its day to day management of the portfolio  

MetLife makes debt and equity investments in renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar  Specifically, since 2003, MetLife invested approximately $29 billion in renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms, as of December 31, 2014 For example, on Long Island, New York, MetLifes partnership with the US Department of Energy, BP Solar (British Petroleum) and the Long Island Power Authority resulted in the construction of the largest solar photovoltaic plant in the eastern United States

MetLife also supports environmental programs through its Community Investments Program One example was MetLifes $10 million commitment to Essential Capital Consortium, a fund that makes senior loans to Social Businesses that provide goods or services that directly seek to improve the lives of low-income residents in developing countries  One of three sectors supported by the fund is energy-transitioning toward a cleaner and energy-efficient global economy Another example was MetLifes commitment of $5 million to SJF Ventures III, LP, a fund that invests in high growth, positive-impact companies in the United States  The fund manager has a 15+ year track record of supporting entrepreneurs primarily in businesses with favorable environmental impact that provide good jobs

Allstate has established an absolute emissions reduction goal aimed at reducing energy use at owned facilities to 2o% below 2007 levels by 2020 and is continuously working to identify and act on other non-energy related emissions reduction opportunities As of December 2012, Allstate has reduced Scope 1, 2, and select Scope 3 emissions by approximately 22% compared to a 2007 baseline

A sampling of projects implemented to date include installation of more efficient light fixtures, reductions in the hours lights are used, operation of sophisticated lighting controls which include daylight harvesting features and occupancy sensors, paperless solutions (eBill, ePayments, and ePolicy), real estate consolidation, improvement in fuel economy of the corporate fleet, and building material recycling In total, Allstate estimates these activities resulted in nearly 21,000 MT of CO2 emissions reductions
in 2012 (Scope 1, 2, & 3)

Projects planned for 2013 and beyond include electric vehicle charging stations at corporate office campus in Northbrook, IL To reduce the energy associated with data storage and other computing-intensive processes, Allstate has begun increasing the temperature at owned data centers, thereby reducing the overall cooling load at these facilities

The expectation from NYS DEC is that more warming will occur in Northeastern New York Its predicted that by 2100 the growing season will be 1 month longer with intense summers (heat waves and extreme heat) and milder winters Also predicted is a continual increase in precipitation

When considering individual investments as well as the aggregate amount of investment categories the Companies consider risks beyond the traditional investing frameworks of credit worthiness and growth potential A holistic approach to investment risk considers political, macroeconomic, environmental and potential correlations with other risks the Companies accept For example, climate risk is often associated with underwriting risks that the Companies manage with geographic concentration analysis and reinsurance A large loss may impact the Companies underwriting results, reinsurance collectability, the credit quality of a reinsurers bonds and the value of the reinsurers equity Similarly, societal initiatives to reduce carbon emission may impact private or municipally owned electric utilities as well as global demand for fossil fuels which may impact asset values

The potential for climate change risk impacting the portfolio is addressed holistically and not isolated to a particular investment type  Accordingly, all of the Companies risk monitoring beginning with asset allocation through individual asset purchase limits assists with monitoring each individual risk

The Companies also believe that the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which holds that all known risks are discounted in the current price of an asset, adequately discounts risks such as climate change by the pricing mechanism inherent within capital markets  Risks such as climate change are discounted within the price of an individual asset

"  Regulatory risks as diverse as insurance regulatory obligations, emissions caps, base load management requirements, and building code requirements could impact the insurance business  Regulation, as well, can have the unintended consequence of masking risk based price signals and could cause stakeholders to increase climate related risk  rather than manage and reduce such risks  For example, subsidizing property insurance premiums, or flood insurance premiums or providing insurance or agreements to re-build in regularly eroded coastal locations or high risk fire areas could cause increase of building in such locations in a manner economically inconsistent with the physical risks presented by climate change

Regulatory uncertainty and regulation that is not economically well-grounded can create additional risk for both insurers and society  Even where public policies are well grounded in sound economic policy, multi-state and nationally active insurers will likely be required to address potentially disparate and conflicting climate policies and rules and bear the associated costs 

These generally complex issues involving the interplay of new requirements within existing legal structures create unique risks; results of the same public policy will likely be different when applied in different jurisdictions - unless the results of interplay are completely and accurately analyzed in the development of such policy

Potential unintended negative consequences of regulatory action could pose a challenge for the industry, such as where the true economic cost of new legislation has not been well thought through or where the new legislation results in a disproportionate allocation of costs of climate related risk  In addition, competing requirements could mean that compliance in one jurisdiction may not satisfy other jurisdictions, thus creating duplicative or additive expenditures in the development of adaptive risk management solutions without demonstrable economic or social benefit  Additionally, regulatory actions may restrict a company from making needed changes to its pricing or prompt litigation which could put a financial strain on the organization

As the insurance industry faces regulatory risk, they face legal risk as well  Climate-related legislation that is not well-crafted may create incentives for lawsuits in some jurisdictions  Even in the absence of new laws, there have already been and may continue to be attempts to use existing laws to bring more climate change-related litigation against sovereign entities and companies in particular sectors

With respect to an insurers own operations and physical facilities, regulatory initiatives relating to emissions limits, transportation, water and energy use could impact office planning, employee commuting patterns and general resource usage  Within Farmers, activities to help respond to these trends have begun, including telecommuting, meetings held via phone, video and webinar, recycling and other environmentally-friendly practices

Farmers also has exposure to physical risks of climate change with respect to its own operations and as a result of exposures of its insureds assumed by Farmers though insurance policies  As outlined in the previous section, the physical risks impacting Farmers customers, as a result of climate change, may generate higher volatility in claims

A growing consensus among climate change experts suggests that changing weather patterns present risks of concern related to climate change  Direct impacts such as increased frequency and severity of precipitation events, droughts, and wildfire are among the multiplicity of potential conditions that could impact ultimate loss events for insureds  The risk of these events could also pose a financial strain on the organization  Improved resilience and customers risk management actions continue to be significant foci of Farmers  The potential indirect physical and public health impact, such as increased frequency of widespread disease events and localized food and water shortages, may also affect many areas of property and casualty insurance  Such physical risks have both obvious and subtle consequences for insurers  These vulnerabilities, risks, and consequences are considered as an integrated part of the underwriting process in a manner appropriate given the tenor of the insurance instrument and the manifestation of variability, risk management vulnerability reductions and impacts

With regard to the insurers' own operations or investments, insurers, like their customers, have facilities and operations that are exposed to physical risks of climate change described above  Climate change (severe drought) may drive people/employees away from California, which could be damaging to a Southern California based company

"  Liberty Mutual has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors
A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes   The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk  Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest exposure simulation models from AIR and Risk Management Solutions  As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe exposures  
A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds  By using both the exposure simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities  This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions  Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, catastrophe bonds, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds
Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management  This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models  Specific to climate change, the R&D team focuses on models for hurricanes and severe convective storms, which comprise the majority of the Companys natural catastrophe exposure  All model improvements are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures
When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty Mutual utilizes a warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog  This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average  This ensures that Liberty Mutual is taking a conservative view of natural catastrophe risk and exposed capital
Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact  Liability risks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee  
Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Company's ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest exposure simulation models from AIR and Risk Management Solutions As such, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Company's natural catastrophe exposures
A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the exposure simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual is able to estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, catastrophe bonds, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Company's net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds
Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models Specific to climate change, the R&D team focuses on models for hurricanes and severe convective storms, which comprise the majority of the Company's natural catastrophe exposure All model improvements are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutual's own portfolio of exposures
When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty Mutual utilizes a warm sea surface temperature (""WSST"") event catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average This ensures that Liberty Mutual is taking a conservative view of natural catastrophe risk and exposed capital
Another vital component of the Liberty Mutual's ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee
Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors"	579	en	mild gibberish

public benefit corporation organized under Delaware Law and a Certified B-Corp (Parent
or collectively Lemonade) hereby submit the following in response to the annual
mandatory Insurer Climate Risk Disclosure Survey As a relatively new player in the
personal lines property and casualty space formed on a completely digital platform, we
recognize our responsibility to evaluate business opportunities and mitigate business risk
driven by climate change impact, and to do our part to ensure an insurable, resilient and
sustainable world We view climate change risks in two ways, one as risk to our business
and second as risk to the planet
Our founders set out to create an insurance Company for the future that reimagined the
traditional insurance model We strive to minimize volatility while maximizing trust and
social impact, by creating an aligned, trustful and values rich relationship with customers
Our desire to maintain rigorous standards of social and environmental performance,
accountability, and transparency made Lemonades choice to become a Certified B Corp
natural
The term ""Certified B Corp"" does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead
refers to companies that are certified by B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization The
first step in becoming a Certified B Corp is taking and passing a comprehensive and
objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment The
assessment varies depending on the Company's number of employees, business sector, and
location The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent
governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corp
By completing a set of over 200 questions that reflect impact indicators, best practices, and
outcomes, and are customized for the Company being assessed, a Company receives a
composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees,
customers, communities, and the environment Representative indicators in the assessment
range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community
service, and use of renewable energy
Certification as a Certified B Corp requires that a Company achieve a reviewed assessment
score of at least 80 The review process includes a phone review and a random selection of
indicators for which documentation is verified The assessment also includes a disclosure
questionnaire, including any sensitive practices, fines, and sanctions related to the
Company or its partners
Our certification also required Lemonade to adopt the public benefit corporation structure,
a step we have already completed Once certified, every Certified B Corp must make its
assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website
Acceptance as a Certified B Corp and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the
independent organization A comprehensive re-certification is required every three years
Our next recertification will occur in 2022
The Company is a relatively small, young and completely digital insurance Company,
and as such a plan for reduction and mitigation of emissions in our operations is not
necessary, and as we grow and our footprint expands, we are conscientious about
keeping social and environmental factors central to our planning
Presently and for the foreseeable future, we rely completely on virtual cloud infrastructure
services hosted in AWS Web Services (""AWS"") which eliminates traditional data centers
and their related energy consumption We not only subscribe to the purpose driven
B-Corp principles but have made them part of the fabric of our Company, and are
committed to remaining continually mindful of the challenges climate change imposes on
operations as we consider business strategies and execution of those strategies"	0	", a

" Below is an overview of Libertys energy reduction initiatives, recognitions, and awards

LEED Building Certification 

 Liberty Mutual has earned LEED certification for six buildings and ENERGY STAR labels for eight buildings 
 To meet the guidelines for these standards, the Company applies a wide range of energy efficiency strategies including the addition of energy-efficient bulbs that use under one watt of energy per square foot, automatic flush toilets and automatic water spouts, lighting control systems that turn lights off after business hours in all common hallways, and occupancy sensors that control lights in offices and conference rooms 
 As the Company builds new and retro-fits existing buildings to LEED standards, Liberty Mutual mandates that all construction contractors on its work sites follow indoor air quality guidelines and practices Examples include using recycled/recyclable carpet, low VOC (volatile organic compounds) adhesives, sealants, and paints Liberty Mutuals 22-story Boston office building was designed to be more energy efficient than a typical large modern office building and has achieved LEED Silver certification 
 At the Companys Dover, NH facility, Liberty Mutual replaced all of the 1,000-watt metal halide parking lot lights with 288-watt LEDs lights for a savings of 712 watts per fixture and a cost reduction of $458 per light Overall, the LED lights have shown a 60 percent to 70 percent savings each month compared to the old metal halides Because of the success of the light replacement project in NH, Liberty Mutual recently installed 28 LED lights in its Weston office parking lot
 Old office furniture and supplies from the Boston, Weston, and NH offices are donated to the Furniture Trust 
 By maintaining a focus on energy reduction initiatives as well as on implementing building operating best practices, Liberty Mutual continues to drive down overall energy consumption across its owned building portfolio

Catering and Cafeteria 

 Liberty Mutual has two recycling programs for excess food in its Boston facility and implemented the same programs at Plano, TX in 2018 Liberty Mutual also plans to implement these programs in other facilities within the year The programs are:
o The Boston facility has a composter into which all unused food waste goes In 2017, 159 tons of organic waste was produced and recycled The compost is then donated to a local farm where it is bagged and sold as fertilizer 
o The Bring Your Own Cup Program continues to be encouraged to reduce disposable cup usage
 Liberty Mutual is piloting the use of compostable and re-usable dinner wares in the new Plano cafeteria, so the Company may have an opportunity to learn and apply this to other cafeterias during major remodels or when opening new locations 
 The Companys cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc

Paper, Printing and Office Supplies

 The Companys Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2017 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,417 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 3,500,687 pounds of CO2 avoided, 40,567 trees saved, 66 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 12,088 cubic yards of landfill space conserved 
 Through Print$mart, in 2017 employees conserved 156 million gallons of water, saved 18,424 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,184 tons and reduced gas emissions by 768 tons
 Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer content During 2017, these initiatives have saved 215,959 gallons of water, 474 trees, 44,847 pounds of CO2 and 42,555 kWh 

Auto Program and Commuting 

 100% of the companys automotive fleet consist of either PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) or flex-fuel vehicles 
 In 2017, the company reduced its fleet by 23%, reduced business miles driven by 88%, and transitioned 62% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 2,243 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2016 to 2017 
 Liberty Mutual offers employees the ability to purchase pre-tax transit and monthly parking permits and encourages employee usage of commuting alternatives to driving alone 
 At office locations with the largest employee populations, Liberty Mutual has partnerships with local transit agencies and other stakeholders to tailor our employee commuter amenities to the commuting demographic of the area Some of these offerings include priority rideshare parking, electrical charging stations, commuter counseling, and lockers and showers for cyclists and those who commute by foot 
 Through these efforts, Liberty Mutual is aiding employees with their commutes and meeting the various state trip reduction regulations These regulations are state, county, or city specific and require businesses of certain sizes to achieve a defined reduction of single occupant commuting vehicles These efforts also help Liberty Mutual contribute to national standards around the reduction of carbon emissions

* The Company's cafeteria partner, Eurest, has a sustainability program that includes sourcing fish from a sustainable supply chain, adjusting menu options to be more sustainable (example: less beef, more produce), using Imperfectly Delicious Produce (produce that would be discarded in the field because it is not cosmetically perfect), cage-free eggs, reducing the amount of wasted food during preparation, sourcing ingredients locally if possible, etc
Paper, Printing and Office Supplies
* The Company's Records Management department works closely with a record storage vendor to shred and recycle files eligible for destruction Through its secure shredding program, in 2017 Liberty Mutual recycled 2,417 short tons of paper, which were transported to paper mills for pulping resulting in the following eco-friendly results: 3,500,687 pounds of CO2 avoided, 40,567 trees saved, 66 million gallons of water conserved, and approximately 12,088 cubic yards of landfill space conserved
* Through Print$mart, in 2017 employees conserved 156 million gallons of water, saved 18,424 trees, reduced CO2 emissions by 2,184 tons and reduced gas emissions by 768 tons
* Office supply order minimums cuts down on emissions by reducing the number of deliveries Further, we purchase office supplies that are manufactured with an average of 37% post-consumer content During 2017, these initiatives have saved 215,959 gallons of water, 474 trees, 44,847 pounds of CO2 and 42,555 kWh
Auto Program and Commuting
* 100% of the company's automotive fleet consist of either PZEV (partial zero emission vehicle) or flex-fuel vehicles
* In 2017, the company reduced its fleet by 23%, reduced business miles driven by 88%, and transitioned 62% of its fleet from 6 to 4 cylinder vehicles These changes to the vehicle program resulted in a positive impact of 2,243 tons of CHG saved in the same period from 2016 to 2017
* Liberty Mutual offers employees the ability to purchase pre-tax transit and monthly parking permits and encourages employee usage of commuting alternatives to driving alone
* At office locations with the largest employee populations, Liberty Mutual has partnerships with local transit agencies and other stakeholders to tailor our employee commuter amenities to the commuting demographic of the area Some of these offerings include priority rideshare parking, electrical charging stations, commuter counseling, and lockers and showers for cyclists and those who commute by foot
* Through these efforts, Liberty Mutual is aiding employees with their commutes and meeting the various state trip reduction regulations These regulations are state, county, or city specific and require businesses of certain sizes to achieve a defined reduction of single occupant commuting vehicles These efforts also help Liberty Mutual contribute to national standards around the reduction of carbon emissions

" Loss drivers are mainly socioeconomic factors (eg expand-ing urban areas, higher values, settlement in exposed areas) However climate change (CC) might al-so be a driver of this trend CC translates into changes in the frequency and intensity of weather-related natural hazards Changing climate conditions leading to higher loss levels are not automatical-ly balanced in that way, giving rise to solvency issues if going undetected for many years This is true for both climate variability (eg the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation influencing hurricane activity lev-els) and long-term anthropogenic CC Therefore, from a risk management perspective it is crucial to understand the components of change in risk accounted for by external drivers such as climate Ac-cording to data gathered by Munich Res NatCatSERVICE (loss database for natural catastrophes), there is an increase in weather-related natural catastrophes: the average for the last ten years (20032012) is significantly higher than the average for the last 30 years (19832012), while geophysical events remained largely unchanged on average In 2012, natural catastrophes caused US $160bn in overall losses and US $65bn in insured losses worldwide The losses were above the ten year aver-age of US$ 50bn for insured losses and slightly below the average of US $165bn for overall losses USA: Around two-thirds of the overall losses and nearly 90% of insured losses in 2012 can be at-tributed to the USA The year's largest insured loss was caused by Hurricane Sandy (US $30bn) fol-lowed by the Midwest drought (US $1517bn) For the period 19802012, some 3,400 loss events in USA are registered, for which 84% of insured losses (US$590bn) can be attributed to various kinds of storm (high insurance density), 9% to climatologically events (extreme temperature, droughts, forest fire), 2% to floods and just 5% to geophysical events Changing climatic conditions are having a con-siderable influence on the variability in severe thunderstorm overall losses in the USA This correlation is documented by a scientific peer-reviewed study Rising variability in thunderstorm-related US losses as a reflection of changes in large-scale thunderstorm forcing This study, conducted in coop-eration with the German Aerospace Center, covers the period from 1970 to 2009 After adjustment of the losses to take account of socio-economic changes, increases in losses still remain, which cannot be explained by changes in exposed values In parallel, there has been an increase in the meteorolog-ical potential for severe thunderstorms and its variability In this study it has been possible for the first time to prove scientifically that climatic changes are already having an impact on US thunderstorm losses

AIG provides a range of products and services across all lines of insurance, helping clients respond to the greening of the economy, expanding natural disaster resilience, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and being proactive against the threat of climate change AIG has taken steps to provide insurance products and solutions that help reduce potential losses that may be caused by climate-change influenced events, including the following initiatives

There may be an opportunity for AIG to build its reputation for its sustainability efforts among consumers, employees, shareholders and other key stakeholders who are increasingly interested in the environment and the impacts of climate change This enhanced reputational regard may lead to an increased demand for AIG products and services

In 2012, AIG PC saw continued interest in existing green products in residential and commercial property insurance that enable customers to rebuild to a higher standard of sustainability in the event of a covered loss, specifically:

1)	Ecosurance® is the portfolio of green products provided by Lexington Insurance Company, AIGs Boston-based surplus lines insurance unit:
	Upgrade to Green® Residential, first launched in 2007, provides coverage for certain products and materials identified as having ENERGY STAR® or equivalent levels of energy efficiency Repairs and replacements include, but are not limited to, lighting systems, heating/cooling equipment, windows, insulation, appliances, home electronics, indoor plumbing, and flooring materials
	Upgrade to Green Commercial responds to covered partial and total losses for both Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certified and non LEED certified buildings In the event of a total loss, LEED certified insureds are provided coverage to upgrade their building to the next level of LEED certification upon reconstruction Non-LEED certified insureds can use the coverage to rebuild to a LEED silver standard
	LexElite Eco-Homeowner® responds to the unique risks faced by homeowners who generate their own power and feed surplus energy back into the local power grid If a homeowners alternative-energy system has a covered outage, LexElite Eco-Homeowner will protect the homeowner against lost income generated from selling surplus energy back to the grid and will cover the extra expenses incurred to purchase replacement electricity
	In August 2009, Lexington launched Upgrade to Green Builders Risk, which provides coverage that supports green building construction and renovation projects registered with the US-based LEED or the GREEN GLOBES® rating systems Available as an endorsement to Lexingtons Completed Value Builders Risk Policy, it extends coverage to address the risks green buildings face during three key areas of construction: project management and administration, site ecological impacts, and consumption of resources

2)	The Private Client Group (PCG) division of AIG PC provides insurance products and loss prevention expertise to high net worth individuals and families Since 2008, this division has introduced several products to encourage property development of high environmental efficiency, including: 
	For US based clients, PCG offers Green Rebuilding Cost, which allows policyholders to rebuild with materials that are more energy efficient, conserve water and other natural resources, and provide a healthier environment inside the home 
	For UK-based clients, PCG offers a Green Rebuilding Cost Coverage as part of its standard Home & Contents policy for high-net worth individuals This covers the installation of green building products that will use less energy, water and/or natural resources, create less waste and provide a healthier environment for residents

3)	Lexington also offers a suite of three insurance solutions for businesses in the developing climate change and greenhouse gas emissions sector:
	Newest to the suite, as of September 2012, is CarbonCover ODS, designed for project developers who are collecting tangible physical assets for the purpose of creating emission reductions and carbon offset credits CarbonCover ODS responds to direct physical loss or damage of a physical asset that is being collected to create carbon offset credits These assets can include ozone depleting substances (ODS) that are removed from refrigeration systems or methane gas that is extracted from landfills or underground mines Direct physical loss or damage to the asset is measured as the value of the carbon offset credits that would have been issued for the destroyed asset absent the loss, in accordance with a carbon registrys project protocol
	CarbonCoverSM Registry, launched in January 2010, which provides professional liability insurance for registries that track, confirm, and verify carbon offset credits; and
	CarbonCover Design & Confirm, extends Lexingtons architects and engineers professional liability coverage to expressly cover claims arising from greenhouse gas consulting services or emission reduction verification services

4)	In an effort to encourage customers to reduce carbon emissions from vehicle travel and support their efforts toward environmental responsibility, AIG PC introduced the Auto Physical Damage Alternative Fuel Incentive Endorsement in 2010 Available with commercial automobile liability policies, this enhanced coverage allows customers to waive or be reimbursed for their auto physical damage deductible, up to a maximum of $1,000, if a covered gasoline powered vehicle is deemed a total loss and is replaced with a green automobile This endorsement builds on two products launched by The Private Client Group division of AIG PC in 2008: New Vehicle Replacement Coverage and the 5% Hybrid Vehicle Discount Under the former, if a new vehicle is totaled within three years of its purchase, the client can opt to receive the agreed value, replace it with a vehicle of the same year, make and model, or receive a new vehicle of the same make and like model, including hybrids or alternate fuel editions The latter applies a discount to bodily injury liability, property damage liability, medical payments, uninsured motorist, collision and comprehensive coverages for owners of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles"	5	"For example, a ""green"" property endorsement in the US and the UK provides an environmentally friendly property reinstatement in the event of a covered loss, in a manner required to minimize the potential harm to the environment

Our fourth release of the Supplier Self-Assessment Sustainability Scorecard engaged more suppliers than the previous year For instance, we collect metrics such as whether the suppliers have environmental policies, management systems, supplier sustainability policies, hold green building certifications, among others Humana invited 78 suppliers to participate in the survey in 2020 21 of our suppliers responded for a rate of 27% Those 21 suppliers made up approximately $800M in 2020 spend, which represented about 20% of our total spend in 2020  The Scorecard requests are distributed via email and responses are collected through self-reporting of the suppliers Pending our availability, we follow up through one-on-one engagement Via the Scorecard, we collect information from key suppliers regarding their efforts to reduce the environmental impacts associated with their vendor engagement with Humana  This initiative helped us understand the environmental impact of our vendor relationships and set the stage for more robust data collection; findings are reported in our CSR report updates, internal scorecard, and to Humana leadership  We aim to expand this initiative in the future by engaging suppliers that represent the greatest impact As our supply chain program evolves, implementation of the supplier scorecard process will be evaluated on its ability to support our efforts in meeting CDP expectations, assist with sourcing decisions, mitigate risk, and be used as a tracking tool for business reviews  We have strengthened our approach by initiating information requests for larger suppliers during the contract renewal or new vendor engagement process; this underscores our intention to maintain this practice for these suppliers on an annual basis

After setting new emissions reduction and waste diversion targets to ensure continued improvement in 2018 and beyond, we engaged a new facilities management vendor with formalized expectations of their collaborative requirements to ensure attainment of our new targets These expectations were included in the RFP when soliciting bids in an effort to elevate our sustainability progress; responding vendors then provided their expertise and recommendations to help us achieve our sustainability targets, which informed our final decision-making  

We also proactively work to connect our suppliers and associates to identify opportunities to collaborate and improve our environmental sustainability For example, several suppliers presented at multiple sustainability fairs held at Humana in 2016 and 2017, allowing associates to understand how the procured services address sustainability During our Inclusion & Diversity Day, employees were encouraged to provide feedback on supplier sustainability efforts

" ClimateWise leads collaborative research and analysis initiatives that may indirectly influence public policy on climate change For example, AIG participated in the ClimateWise Collaboration on City Resilience, focusing on the importance of urban resilience to the insurance industry, and what the sector can do to respond to increasing climate change related risks to cities In 2012, the ClimateWise convened city leaders, key sector clients such as property owners and utility companies, and insurers to focus on the question, How do we accelerate action to in long-term resilience to keep American cities performing in the face of more extreme and unpredictable climate risks? 

As a member of ClimateWise, AIG also responds to the annual ClimateWise survey on performance against six principles of sustainability: leading in risk analysis, informing public policy-making, supporting climate awareness amongst customers, incorporating climate change into investment strategies, reducing the environmental impact of business, and reporting and being accountable According to ClimateWise, these Principles enable leading insurers to work together to respond to the myriad risks and opportunities of climate change, aiming to reduce the overall risks faced by economies and societies

Next, as an annual respondent to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), AIG is voluntarily part of the key constituency of companies and cities that measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information about both our impact on the environment and our actions to reduce impacts In early 2013, AIG also became a member of CDP Reporter Services, which provides data, support and insights to reduce emissions and improve business performance As a member, AIG can benchmark performance against peers and identify material risks and opportunities using CDPs vast source of primary climate-change data 

Finally, by joining the New York City Mayors Carbon Challenge, AIG is part of a NYC constituency that includes 17 of the leading universities, the 11 largest hospital systems, and nine other global commercial corporations with significant office space in New York City The Mayor's Carbon Challenge invites these private and institutional sectors to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 30% over 10 years Together, these participants account for nearly 4% of citywide emissions, meaning that our efforts will translate to a 13% reduction in citywide emissions, assuming no change in baseline square feet 

Commercial buildings account for 21% of New York City's emissions, and energy use in interior offices and leased spaces account for between 40-60% of end use in a typical commercial office building As one of the 10 participants in the challenge to commercial offices, AIG will focus on energy efficiency in interior office spaces and leased spaces through innovative strategies such as IT efficiency, plug load reductions, space layout optimization, and lighting upgrades

" This strategy utilizes our expertise in identifying and managing risk and providing solutions The strategic plan focuses on the management of our operations and it is multifaceted, with elements concentrating on emissions from our facilities, fleet and travel management, paper reduction and related communication activities to key constituencies These are discussed in more detail below 

Many areas across Chubb are involved in the plan and its execution The areas include the Corporate Responsibility Office, the Chief Risk Officer, Administrative Services, the Strategic Business Units, Claims and other functional departments Recognizing the importance of environmental stewardship to our employees and other stakeholders, in 2013 we created the Corporate Responsibility Office to better coordinate and communicate our corporate citizenship activities, including our emissions reduction efforts In addition to working closely with the areas listed above, the office encourages and supports the formation of local cross-functional teams focused on reducing energy usage, paper usage and/or other initiatives to reduce our environmental impact

Annual emissions reduction and mitigation actions:
As part of our business operations, we have an annual planning process that includes emissions reduction and mitigation activities
As a result, since 2008 in the facilities we manage in the United States, we have:
	Reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by almost 18% 
	Reduced electric consumption in corporate facilities by over 19% 
	Reduced natural gas consumption in corporate facilities by over 30% 

In 2013, our corporate global headquarters and two other buildings we own received Energy Star Certification

On a monthly basis, we recycle desk-side paper, secured shredded paper, glass, plastic, corrugated (cardboard), batteries, lamps, lamp housing or fixtures, ballasts, thermostats, aluminum, tin, copper, other metals, fryer grease, carpet, refrigerant, oil, diesel, paint, asphalt, chemicals, used equipment and motors On a seasonal basis, we recycle grass clippings, leaves, tree branches and stumps

In our offices we deploy:
	A Green Cleaning Program using cleaning materials which are certified green by Green Seal, Inc
	Paper towels with recycled or post-consumer waste content
	Coreless toilet paper to reduce cardboard roll waste (all New Jersey sites)
	Air fresheners that contain low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) (all New Jersey locations)
	No or low VOC paint
	No or low VOC chemicals when applicable
	New office furniture (desks, chairs, tables, filing cabinets etc) with recycled content, post-consumer or post-industrial waste (when needed)
	New carpet with recycled content (when needed)
	No or low VOC carpet adhesive
	New ceiling tiles (USG 450 White Frost) with over 50% recycled content and that have zero emissions (when needed, global headquarters location)
	Environmentally friendly roadway de-icing pellets (Whitehouse Station, NJ, location)

Energy savings for those buildings we lease and/or manage are achieved by:
	Conducting energy audits
	Having the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment and systems retro-commissioned
	Replacing failed appliances with Energy Star certified appliances (hot water heaters, refrigerators, dish washing machines)
	Replacing all failed motors with more energy efficient models (when applicable), and controlling motors by Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to modulate the motor speed based on need 
	Replacing heating and cooling units with more energy efficient units 
	Using building automation systems to efficiently operate lighting and HVAC systems based on need

As we renovate or relocate our non-owned/managed offices around the globe, we seek ways to reduce our environmental footprint For example, when we relocated our Atlanta branch in 2013, the corporate real estate team selected space in a LEED Silver certified building The building's certification was based on its proximity and shuttle service to MARTA, the local public transportation system; an on-site bank and restaurant; shuttle service to nearby shopping; a 3,500-square-foot training facility, which enables tenants to reduce their space requirements; and a building energy management system We designed the space with several environmental-friendly elements in mind By leaving part of the ceiling exposed, polishing concrete floors and leaving columns unfinished, we were able to reduce our consumption of carpeting, drywall and other materials Locating offices on the interior of the floor also reduced material usage and enabled us to take advantage of natural light and airflow, and the installation of efficient workstations helped minimize our square footage requirements 

Telecommuting:
	Chubb offers employee telecommuting and compressed work weeks Approximately 15% of our US based workforce teleworks 1 or more days per week In addition, approximately 3% of the US workforce is on a compressed work schedule

Fleet and Travel Management:
	We transitioned to a four-cylinder fleet in 2011 Each vehicle is replaced at 45,000 miles The overall fleet benefits from continuous improvements in fuel economy and carbon reduction technology, which has further improved GHG benefits by reducing the total carbon in 2013 another 25%, the equivalent of removing eighteen vehicles from the fleet
	In 2010, we introduced a policy encouraging employees to rent a car for all daily business trips in excess of 150 miles  The rental vehicles offered are 4-cylinder, thus limiting usage of personal cars, which may be SUVs, trucks or 6- or 8-cylinder sedans  In 2013, 75% of rentals were for four-cylinder vehicles 
	As of year-end 2013, nearly 1,300 Chubb travelers opted in to receive electronic copies, instead of paper copies, of hotel folios  
	As part of our annual hotel RFP process, Chubb Travel Services has made a concerted effort to partner with suppliers who have strong corporate responsibility and sustainability programs and projects  One major hotel chain partner has experienced a 9% reduction in energy consumption, and has lowered GHG emissions by 10% and water consumption by 7% 

Paper reduction:
	Paperless initiatives in all three Strategic Business Units, Claims, Billing and HR, combined saved over 15 million sheets of paper of paper in 2013 Examples include:
¿	100% of Chubb agents who write commercial direct bill business (where customers are billed and remit premiums directly to Chubb) review monthly commission statements on line 
¿	Chubb's Agency Bill agents are divided between those that submit a report of premiums due to us versus those that receive from us a statement of premiums due  90% of agents submitting a report of premiums due to us do so electronically while 100% of those receiving a statement of premiums due receive that statement electronically 
¿	Premium Accounting's Legal Collections unit serves as the liaison between Chubb and a number of outside collection agencies who are assigned premiums to collect on our behalf when internal collection efforts have been exhausted  100% of the communications between Chubb and those outside firms takes place electronically and all internal records are maintained in a paperless environment
¿	Premium Accounting has seen a 85% reduction in the receipt of paper checks in its bank lock box utilized for national brokers  Paper check receipts in 2013 totaled 5,000 while we project 800 paper checks received for 2014  Payments are instead being electronically wire transferred directly into Chubb's account
¿	988% of our payroll advices are online
¿	Personal Lines customers have the option to receive their policy electronically 
¿	Commercial Lines customers can remit payments over the phone or online
¿	98% of the documentation Personal Lines sends to agents and brokers in the US is done so electronically
¿	62% of our Commercial Lines agents are enrolled in our paper-free program 
¿	100% of all new claims are now digitized and stored/archived electronically 
¿	In 2013, the Claim Department completed full deployment of a document management system that digitizes all physical incoming claim mail  During 2013, more than one million electronic documents were digitized, rather than printed, by the Claim Department 

We recognize that our customers, employees and other key stakeholders are increasingly interested in our sustainability efforts, including with respect to emissions reduction, and an area of focus for the Corporate Responsibility Office is communicating our efforts  One of the Corporate Responsibility Offices first actions was to launch an internal social media site to communicate our actions, to engage employees and to share recommendations on managing and reducing environmental impact at the office and at home  The site launch included a video featuring the President of Personal Lines and Claims discussing the importance corporate responsibility at Chubb

We provide updates on our plans and progress toward meeting goals in our response to the CDP, as well as periodically on wwwchubbcom and through customer communications For example, we send communications to our personal lines policyholders to encourage them to make the world a greener place by enrolling in our paperless option - ePolicy"	0	"This strategy utilizes our expertise in identifying and managing risk and providing solutions The strategic plan focuses on the management of our operations and it is multifaceted, with elements concentrating on emissions from our facilities, fleet and travel management, paper reduction and related communication activities to key constituencies These are discussed in more detail below

* Environmentally friendly roadway de-icing pellets (Whitehouse Station, NJ, location)
Energy savings for those buildings we lease and/or manage are achieved by:
* Conducting energy audits
* Having the HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment and systems retro-commissioned
* Replacing failed appliances with Energy Star certified appliances (hot water heaters, refrigerators, dish washing machines)
* Replacing all failed motors with more energy efficient models (when applicable), and controlling motors by Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) to modulate the motor speed based on need
* Replacing heating and cooling units with more energy efficient units
* Using building automation systems to efficiently operate lighting and HVAC systems based on need
As we renovate or relocate our non-owned/managed offices around the globe, we seek ways to reduce our environmental footprint For example, when we relocated our Atlanta branch in 2013, the corporate real estate team selected space in a LEED Silver certified building The building's certification was based on its proximity and shuttle service to MARTA, the local public transportation system; an on-site bank and restaurant; shuttle service to nearby shopping; a 3,500-square-foot training facility, which enables tenants to reduce their space requirements; and a building energy management system We designed the space with several environmental-friendly elements in mind By leaving part of the ceiling exposed, polishing concrete floors and leaving columns unfinished, we were able to reduce our consumption of carpeting, drywall and other materials Locating offices on the interior of the floor also reduced material usage and enabled us to take advantage of natural light and airflow, and the installation of efficient workstations helped minimize our square footage requirements
Telecommuting:
* Chubb offers employee telecommuting and compressed work weeks Approximately 15% of our US based workforce teleworks 1 or more days per week In addition, approximately 3% of the US workforce is on a compressed work schedule
Fleet and Travel Management:
* We transitioned to a four-cylinder fleet in 2011 Each vehicle is replaced at 45,000 miles The overall fleet benefits from continuous improvements in fuel economy and carbon reduction technology, which has further improved GHG benefits by reducing the total carbon in 2013 another 25%, the equivalent of removing eighteen vehicles from the fleet
* In 2010, we introduced a policy encouraging employees to rent a car for all daily business trips in excess of 150 miles The rental vehicles offered are 4-cylinder, thus limiting usage of personal cars, which may be SUVs, trucks or 6- or 8-cylinder sedans In 2013, 75% of rentals were for four-cylinder vehicles
* As of year-end 2013, nearly 1,300 Chubb travelers opted in to receive electronic copies, instead of paper copies, of hotel folios
* As part of our annual hotel RFP process, Chubb Travel Services has made a concerted effort to partner with suppliers who have strong corporate responsibility and sustainability programs and projects One major hotel chain partner has experienced a 9% reduction in energy consumption, and has lowered GHG emissions by 10% and water consumption by 7%
Paper reduction:
* Paperless initiatives in all three Strategic Business Units, Claims, Billing and HR, combined saved over 15 million sheets of paper of paper in 2013 Examples include:
? 100% of Chubb agents who write commercial direct bill business (where customers are billed and remit premiums directly to Chubb) review monthly commission statements on line
? Chubb's Agency Bill agents are divided between those that submit a report of premiums due to us versus those that receive from us a statement of premiums due 90% of agents submitting a report of premiums due to us do so electronically while 100% of those receiving a statement of premiums due receive that statement electronically
? Premium Accounting's Legal Collections unit serves as the liaison between Chubb and a number of outside collection agencies who are assigned premiums to collect on our behalf when internal collection efforts have been exhausted 100% of the communications between Chubb and those outside firms takes place electronically and all internal records are maintained in a paperless environment
? Premium Accounting has seen a 85% reduction in the receipt of paper checks in its bank lock box utilized for national brokers Paper check receipts in 2013 totaled 5,000 while we project 800 paper checks received for 2014 Payments are instead being electronically wire transferred directly into Chubb's account
? 988% of our payroll advices are online
? Personal Lines customers have the option to receive their policy electronically
? Commercial Lines customers can remit payments over the phone or online
? 98% of the documentation Personal Lines sends to agents and brokers in the US is done so electronically
? 62% of our Commercial Lines agents are enrolled in our paper-free program
? 100% of all new claims are now digitized and stored/archived electronically
? In 2013, the Claim Department completed full deployment of a document management system that digitizes all physical incoming claim mail During 2013, more than one million electronic documents were digitized, rather than printed, by the Claim Department
We recognize that our customers, employees and other key stakeholders are increasingly interested in our sustainability efforts, including with respect to emissions reduction, and an area of focus for the Corporate Responsibility Office is communicating our efforts One of the Corporate Responsibility Office's first actions was to launch an internal social media site to communicate our actions, to engage employees and to share recommendations on managing and reducing environmental impact at the office and at home The site launch included a video featuring the President of Personal Lines and Claims discussing the importance corporate responsibility at Chubb
We provide updates on our plans and progress toward meeting goals in our response to the CDP, as well as periodically on wwwchubbcom and through customer communications For example, we send communications to our personal lines policyholders to encourage them to ""make the world a greener place"" by enrolling in our paperless option - ePolicy"	1780	en	mild gibberish

" Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting  and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope 

Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 

1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy
 
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 


Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities

For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:

Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;

Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;

Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio

In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f

We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
 
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 23% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments  Furthermore, we also invest in the US, UK and Australian real estate markets, reaching a total size of USD 17 billion by the end of 2018

The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The US portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities The portfolio outperformed the GRESB average of 68/100 with a score of 78/100

" It may include the effects from the increase in severity and occurrence of climate change-related weather events (some may include but are not limited to: thunderstorms - including severe hail and strong winds; tornadoes; hurricanes; windstorms; the aftermath of floods; heat waves; droughts; rise in sea-level; forest fires; grass fires and the resultant subsequent debilitating effects created by these events)

Although State Farm does not specifically differentiate any increase or decrease in severity and occurrence of weather events to specific measures of climate, State Farm continuously measures and models risk for the perils insured under its contracts to determine its total risk exposure including those related to weather events Over the period from 1984 - 2019, non-hurricane catastrophe losses have been increasing by an average of 24%, with four of the largest ten non-hurricane catastrophe years occurring in the last ten years after adjusting for policy growth   This trend is the result of several factors such as population concentration, population shift to the coastal regions and other catastrophe prone areas, land use, as well as, changes to weather patterns related to climate change 

Climate change is a recognized risk category on the risk register managed by Enterprise Risk Management  Evaluating climate change risk is done by the various units of the company(s) handling separate general functions, such as administrative services, investments, law department, public affairs, underwriting and actuarial, and the information developed is reported through the Enterprise Risk Management process to the Risk Committee of the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company Board   Within each function, there are several individuals and teams responsible for identifying and monitoring the potential risk and creating strategies to mitigate and manage such risk to financially sound levels  Each function team is evaluating and determining how best to approach the evaluation For example, multiple models are used to underwrite certain exposures, including those based on historical data and others on changing weather patterns  In these efforts to evaluate and model weather related effects State Farm is continuously investing in the latest tools and improving techniques to model severe weather in order to accurately measure risk to better match risk to price of the various products

State Farm is taking several actions to address the risk of climate change, which includes maintaining a focus on environmental sustainability efforts  State Farm is committed to operating in environmentally sustainable ways and building safer, stronger, and more sustainable communities, demonstrated by the establishment of a dedicated cross-departmental team in 2019 to execute on the State Farm environmental sustainability strategy focused on supporting internal operations, strengthening and promoting community resilience, and promoting responsible business practices 

State Farm promotes improved building code adoption through its federal and state lobbying efforts to help mitigate potential risk Additionally, State Farm works with organizations across the country, such as the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, engaging in research which may help protect customers from injuries, property destruction, and financial harm that can result from natural disasters State Farm is also a member of the Build-Strong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use, and general awareness of mitigation issues 

Yes - The company has a climate change policy with respect to investment management

Risks associated with State Farms investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farms financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders  State Farms investment analysis evaluates all material risk factors, including Environmental, Social, and Governance factors that may have an impact on a companys future prospects, operating performance, or future valuation  Additionally, State Farm monitors and evaluates changes in climate and weather patterns in conjunction with assessments of changing sources of energy and the innovation necessary to produce economic and reliable energy 
 
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding  Restrictions on investments in unregulated coal-fueled energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry  Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are considered when evaluating investments in municipalities  In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification  We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy 

Additionally, we provide financing to entities that are engaged in energy efficiency projects as well as other green initiatives as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies
  
The Investment Committee of the Board of Directors receives regular reports of investment diversification and exposures by various classifications, including geographic, industry, and property type

State Farm is taking several actions to address the risk of climate change, which includes maintaining a focus on environmental sustainability efforts State Farm is committed to operating in environmentally sustainable ways and building safer, stronger, and more sustainable communities, demonstrated by the establishment of a dedicated cross-departmental team in 2019 to execute on the State Farm environmental sustainability strategy focused on supporting internal operations, strengthening and promoting community resilience, and promoting responsible business practices
State Farm promotes improved building code adoption through its federal and state lobbying efforts to help mitigate potential risk Additionally, State Farm works with organizations across the country, such as the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, engaging in research which may help protect customers from injuries, property destruction, and financial harm that can result from natural disasters State Farm is also a member of the Build-Strong Coalition These efforts are focused on building codes, land use, and general awareness of mitigation issues
Yes - The company has a climate change policy with respect to investment management
Risks associated with State Farm's investments are continuously monitored and evaluated in order to preserve State Farm's financial strength to ensure we can meet our obligations to our policyholders State Farm's investment analysis evaluates all material risk factors, including Environmental, Social, and Governance factors that may have an impact on a company's future prospects, operating performance, or future valuation Additionally, State Farm monitors and evaluates changes in climate and weather patterns in conjunction with assessments of changing sources of energy and the innovation necessary to produce economic and reliable energy
The impact of climate change is managed through diversification guidelines across various asset types to prevent concentrations in a given geographic location, industry, property type, or municipal funding Restrictions on investments in unregulated coal-fueled energy generation limit our exposure within the utilities industry Coastal and earthquake exposures are managed in our commercial mortgage loan and real estate portfolios and are considered when evaluating investments in municipalities In our real estate portfolio, we focus on the efficient operation of a building in an environmentally responsible manner and we evaluate new investments to determine whether it is economically and physically feasible to achieve a LEED certification We also annually identify capital improvement projects and building system enhancements to reduce the use of energy
Additionally, we provide financing to entities that are engaged in energy efficiency projects as well as other green initiatives as a subset of their business operations, such as municipal and state governments as well as utilities and energy companies
The Investment Committee of the Board of Directors receives regular reports of investment diversification and exposures by various classifications, including geographic, industry, and property type"	925	en	mild gibberish

" A central pillar of the strategy is to reduce its carbon footprint In 2003, Swiss Re became the first major financial player to commit to going carbon neutral

Our strategy to tackle climate change rests on four pillars, one of which is our pledge to reduce our own CO2 emissions Our Greenhouse Neutral Program has been the principal initiative to achieve this goal Originally launched in 2003 for a ten-year period, it combined two commitments:  firstly, to reduce our CO2 emissions per employee (full-time equivalent or FTE) by a specified amount; secondly, to fully offset all the remaining emissions by purchasing high-quality emission reduction credits, thus making the company greenhouse neutral for the whole period between 2003 and 2013 Over the course of the ten years, we gradually raised our reduction target from 15% to 45% per employee By the end of the programs first cycle in 2013, we had achieved a total reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 493% compared to the base year 2003 Our new target until 2020 is to keep our CO2 emissions per employee stable at the level of 2013 In view of our expansive business strategy, especially in high growth markets, we consider this to be an ambitious goal 

For the programs second cycle, we also extended the scope of our emissions reporting and of our offsetting commitment In addition to our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (heating and power consumption) and a major source of Scope 3 emissions (business travel), our reporting now covers further activities along our value chain (Scope 3): employee commuting, copy paper use, waste generation, water use and technical gases Based on this, we extended our commitment to offset the CO2 emissions we cannot avoid to paper, waste, water and technical gases By the end of 2018, our total CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) decreased by 63% and were thus 81% lower than in 2013 We achieved this mainly as a result of 1) further cutting power consumption at our business locations; 2) moving into more energy-efficient buildings, eg in Zurich (Swiss Re Next), New York and Bangalore;  3) increasing the share of renewable power in our operations to 94%, covering now most of the power consumption in APAC; and 4) a decrease in business travel between 2017 and 2018 

Swiss Re has implemented a number of initiatives that reduce our environmental footprint:

	Using renewable power: Purchasing power from renewable rather than conventional sources has been a principal measure of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme Concluding a gradual build-up that started in 2005, we are now using 100% renewable power at all the Groups locations where it is available in reliable and trustworthy quality (ie at a total of 30 locations in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania) This means that approximately 94% of our total power consumption came from renewable sources at the end of 2018 To assess the quality of the renewable power available in individual locations and select suitable sources, we use a minimum standard that clearly states how we define renewable power and what requirements it needs to meet In particular, we pursue the following impactful green power options, with decreasing preference: ¿¿(1) Direct investments in our own solar plants (eg at Armonk, Swiss Re Next, Bangalore, Folkestone); ¿¿(2) Indirect investments via long-term virtual power purchase agreements from newly built plants (we signed our first vPPA with a wind farm in Illinois US last year, covering 100% of our N-American load); (3) Sourcing of high-quality renewable energy certificates (eg naturemade star in Switzerland and NaturEnergie in Germany) 
	Reducing energy consumption: In parallel with our switch to using renewable power, we have made continuous efforts to lower the actual amount of energy consumed per employee (FTE) or, in other words, to reduce our energy intensity Through many small measures to improve energy efficiency and by concentrating backoffice tasks in fewer and more energy-efficient buildings, we managed to cut our energy intensity by a total of 465% between 2003 and 2013 For the current phase of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme from 2013 until 2020, our goal is to continuously reduce our energy intensity by 2% per year At the end of 2018, the total reduction we had reached since 2013 was 289% We partly achieved this by decommissioning existing office buildings and moving into more energy-efficient ones We have also continued our efforts to create more flexible and modern office environments that offer our employees optimal working conditions while, at the same time, using space and resources more effectively The spread of digital communication and devices makes it possible to work seamlessly across different locations and devices, creating the foundation for a more flexible and informal workplace set-up that encourages teamwork At Swiss Re Next, for example, this open workplace concept is a key feature Although further reducing our environmental footprint is not the primary driver of these efforts, their potential to lower the energy intensity of our locations is nevertheless substantial 
	Minimising business travel: As a result of the substantial cuts we have achieved in CO2 emissions from power consumption and heating since 2003, business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emissions source today Since the business trips our employees take are ultimately driven by client needs, they are difficult to influence However, we have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips For a start, we have built up a dense network of video conferencing equipment across the Group Recently, we replaced these facilities with state-of-the-art technology, which creates a real-time, life-size virtual meeting experience in specially designed rooms By the end of 2018, we had a total of 159 video conference facilities worldwide In total, we hosted 97'617 video calls in 2018, amounting to 70'249 hours We continuously monitor all travel budgets and collect travel data centrally Furthermore, we introduced an internal carbon levy on air travel in 2014, which uses the polluter pays principle It allocates the costs of the Voluntary Emissions Reductions (VERs) we need to buy to offset our CO2 emissions to the Groups Global Functions in proportion to their respective share of air travel; previously they had been borne centrally by Group Finance This internal price on carbon heightens awareness of travel costs among our managers and employees and creates a further incentive to reduce air travel, in addition to flight costs Despite these measures, the amount of kilometres travelled per employee and the associated emissions increased for a number of years, mainly driven by our continued expansion in high growth markets After stabilising in 2017, the average total distance travelled by each of our employees decreased by 60% in 2018
	Paper, water and waste: We also calculate and compensate the CO2 emissions from further sources along our supply chain (Scope 3), ie copy paper, waste generation and water use The overview of all our emissions sources on page 47 shows, however, that these are less relevant in our business than other environmental impacts, which is why we have not set quantitative reduction goals for them Furthermore, it is difficult for us to influence water use and waste generation at locations where we rent office space In the office buildings we own ourselves, though, we ensure that appliances meet high standards of water efficiency As paper use is more responsive to managerial action, we have taken a number of measures to reduce the average amount used by our employees in recent years New IT solutions such as pull printing (which eliminates uncollected printouts), web-based collaboration and document management platforms have led to a significant decrease of paper use in all our locations Average paper use per employee fell by 67% in 2018, mainly as a result of ongoing digitisation and measures such as pull printing, leading to a total reduction of almost 60% since 2013
	Offsetting: The second commitment of our Greenhouse Neutral Programme is to compensate all CO2 emissions we cannot avoid For the seven emissions sources covered by it, we bought and retired VERs for a total of 75 794 tonnes of CO2e in 2018 We are keen to ensure that the VERs we buy are of a high environmental standard and have developed a set of criteria to select the projects generating certificates In particular, we give priority to those which create strong social side effects and benefit the poorest regions

In Addition, in December 2019 Liberty Mutual announced its global policy on coal underwriting and investing Liberty Mutual will:
	No longer accept underwriting risk for companies where more than 25 percent of their exposure arises from the extraction and/or production of energy from thermal coal
	Not make new investments in debt or equity securities of companies that generate more than 25 percent of revenues from thermal coal mining or utility companies that generate more than 25 percent of their electricity production from thermal coal
	Phase out coverage and investments for existing risks that exceed this threshold by 2023
Liberty Mutual also has a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program that has oversight from both executive management and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors

A major component of the Companys ERM program is management of natural catastrophe risk from events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, floods, wildfires, drought, and other natural catastrophes The Company closely monitors changes to the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes, as well as changing demographic patterns (eg, coastal migration) which could increase potential exposure to climate risk Liberty Mutual rigorously manages its natural catastrophe exposures through its ERM program, utilizing the latest loss simulation models from catastrophe modeling firms AIR Worldwide and Risk Management Solutions As part of its natural catastrophe modeling and exposure management, Liberty Mutual incorporates the most up to date scientific advances in the estimation of the Companys natural catastrophe loss exposure 

A vital function of ERM is establishing exposure and loss thresholds for natural catastrophe events and ensuring the amount of capital at risk does not exceed these thresholds By using both the loss simulation models, as well as historical loss trend data, Liberty Mutual can estimate losses for natural catastrophe events of various magnitudes and probabilities This information is incorporated into strategic planning, pricing, and reinsurance purchasing decisions Reinsurance products, which include traditional reinsurance, sidecars, and other risk transfer mechanisms, are used to ensure that the Companys net losses (and capital at risk) associated with significant natural catastrophe events does not exceed established thresholds

Liberty Mutual has a catastrophe modeling Research and Development (R&D) team that is tasked with identifying opportunities to improve the accuracy of catastrophe modeling tools utilized by the Company for natural catastrophe exposure management This is accomplished by using new scientific research, tools, and technologies to both modify third party models and create internally developed models The R&D team continues to evaluate the credibility of new modeling methodology for perils such as flood and wildfire as they become available All model methodologies are rigorously back tested against prior event losses, with the goal of improving the predictive capabilities of the models for Liberty Mutuals own portfolio of exposures 

With regard to climate change, the R&D team has primarily focused to date on hurricane risk as this is the companys peak peril When evaluating the potential financial impact of losses related to hurricane exposures, Liberty uses current sea levels in storm surge modeling, which explicitly incorporates the impact of this immediate climate peril in the companys view of hurricane risk Liberty Mutual also reviews the warm sea surface temperature (WSST) event catalog alongside the standard long-term historical catalog This WSST event catalog incorporates the estimated increase in frequency and severity of hurricanes in response to sea surface temperatures that are higher than the long-term historical average due to multidecadal internal variability, a potentially useful proxy for future climate change Ongoing work will apply stress tests affecting future changes in frequency and intensity, to assess the sensitivity of the Liberty portfolio of risks to climate change that are not yet fully attributable to climate change in the historical record Although the scientific evidence on hurricane stalling, rapid intensification, and poleward migration is not yet settled, the R&D team is actively monitoring this emerging research to incorporate into future stress scenarios as needed 

Another vital component of the Liberty Mutuals ERM program is its Emerging Risks Committee, which conducts evaluations of risks that are difficult to quantify, continuing to evolve and could have a material impact Liability risks and economic shocks related to climate change are one of the key emerging risks monitored by this Committee 

Increases in climate hazards may also pose a direct risk to business operations, as many employees are located in regions susceptible to increased climate perils Liberty maintains a robust business continuity program to mitigate this ongoing operational risk

Oversight of investment portfolio risks is also a component of the ERM program, as well as the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors

In addition the ERM team regularly reviews pertinent scientific literature to ensure it understands current thinking on how climate change is impacting the perils that could currently or in future give rise to losses 
While it is clear that there are significant upwards trends in both economic and insured losses arising from natural catastrophes, if one normalizes the losses for changes in exposures and for societal changes these upwards trends largely disappear For example there is no upward trend in the incidence or the intensity of the actual perils for tropical cyclone (hurricane, typhoon), tornado, flood or drought To illustrate this point, the chart below show that over the period 1990 to 2012, global catastrophe economic losses have actually decreased as a percentage of GDP

[Chart]

Similar results are seen for region-specific weather related losses normalized for exposure and societal changes using a number of different methodologies, for example population and wealth per head of population or number of housing units and wealth per household Essentially there is a significant increase in both the number and the values of buildings and contents, oftentimes in areas that are particularly prone to weather-related catastrophes such as Gulf and Florida coastal areas 
We investigate trends in weather related losses by peril, as we recognize that the dominance of wind-related losses may disguise trends in other perils This note is focused on North America, but similar results have been seen in a wide range of studies

Hurricane
Only a small proportion of hurricanes forming in the Atlantic Basin actually make landfall in the USA Taking observations from 1880 onwards, there is actually a slight downward trend in the number of landfalling tropical storms and hurricanes 
The paper Tropical cyclones and climate change, authored by Thomas R Knutson, John L McBride, Johnny Chan, Kerry Emanuel, Greg Holland, Chris Landsea, Isaac Held, James P Kossin, A K Srivastava and Masato Sugi and published in Nature Geoscience in February 2010 suggests that globally we might expect to see an increase in tropical cyclones intensity of between 2% and 11% by 2100, and a decrease in landfalling frequency of between 6% and 34% 
Tornado
Tornado data is available as far back as 1950; however the older years understate the number of the least damaging EF-0 tornadoes The introduction of Dopplar radar combined with increasing population and greater ease of recording and reporting events via cell phones and other mobile devices have greatly increased the number of EF-0 tornadoes reported However, the number of tornadoes for categories EF-1 to EF-5 shows no trend over the period from 1950 onwards losses, nor is there any trend in the proportion in each category EF-1 to EF0-5 Additionally, tornado losses show no trend once they have been normalized for exposure and societal changes

Flood
From a risk management perspective, coastal flooding due to tropical cyclones is considered within our hurricane risk assessment However we also consider riverine flood and groundwater flood If one considers flood losses excluding storm surge associated with hurricanes (and post-tropical cyclones like Sandy), then flood losses are actually a decreasing proportion of the US GDP

Drought
Within the past century, the most significant drought event was the dust bowl of the 1930s During the last century, it is apparent that the El Nino / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have a significant impact on the USA rainfall / drought conditions, but there is no evidence of any long-term change related to climate

Wildfire
If one were considering only the more recent years it would appear that there was an upward trend; however any such trend is much less apparent when the data is considered over a longer period There are a number of factors that might influence acres burned, including controlled (deliberate) burning to reduce wildfire fuel, increased housing density in wildland areas, and periods of drought

" However, through our Corporate Environmental Program, we are committed to measuring, recording and reducing our mark on the environment even further This global effort focuses on reducing the direct and indirect GHG emissions generated from heating, cooling and lighting our offices and from company owned or leased vehicles, as well as the reduction, reuse or recycling of resources  Since 2006, ACE has reduced overall GHG emissions 22% per employee  In 2007 ACE joined the voluntary US Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored Climate Leaders initiative and developed a comprehensive GHG Inventory Management and Reduction Program which included corporate-wide emissions reporting, the establishment of a reduction goal and a strategy for achieving the goal Using the Climate Leaders methodology, ACE set a GHG reduction goal of 8% per employee from 2006-2012 and this goal was achieved three years ahead of schedule Based on these achievements, ACE announced a new corporate-wide Greenhouse Gas reduction goal in 2014: a 10% reduction in emissions per employee from 2012 to 2020 In 2014, ACE reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 47% per employee since 2012 The corporate GHG inventory program still actively uses the EPA Climate Leaders methodology While that program was discontinued in late 2011, it is based on the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) GHG Protocol for data collection and analysis To achieve our GHG reduction goal, ACE will aggressively work to make reductions within the organization The majority of ACEs emissions  approximately 70%  result from electricity use (data centers, plug loads, lighting, etc) and stationary combustion (oil/natural gas) by our offices As a result, ACEs Corporate Environmental Program focuses primarily on reducing our energy consumption at the facility level  specifically, in our owned buildings and larger, long-term leased spaces In 2014, ACE voluntarily implemented several building efficiency projects at our owned facilities including installation of new HVAC equipment, LED lighting as well as Building Automation System (BAS) upgrades and installation Due to green building efforts, ACEs Philadelphia building has reduced energy consumption more than 20% since 2006 through the installation of new boilers, LED lighting, efficient ventilation equipment and variable speed drive HVAC equipment The building earned LEED Silver certification through the US Green Building Council in August 2009 and in November 2014 achieved Gold certification In July 2011, ACEs Bermuda office earned LEED Gold certification due in large part to re-lamping of office lights, applying a floating temperature set point and installing motion sensors and timers on office equipment These actions reduced electrical needs by approximately 500,000 kilowatt-hours (358 metric tons of CO2e) per year ACE furthered its commitment to reducing emissions by earning Energy Star designations for both the Wilmington, Del, and the Philadelphia, Pa, offices in 2015

In 2014, ACE created a targeted energy policy for its operations in Europe, a region that includes 19 countries The policy aims to reduce GHG emissions by establishing building energy benchmarking and pursuing short-term objectives that reduce energy consumption within the region As part of this policy, ACE has conducted an energy audit at the London, UK office, for example, and has identified GHG reduction opportunities that are currently being implemented 

Another approach to reducing our GHG emissions is through decreasing our overall real estate square footage by condensing office locations and increasing the efficiency of work spaces Applying new company standards for the number and size of office and cubicle spaces not only reduces total real estate per-person square footage, but allows more light into the space, which decreases electricity consumption ACE also manages its flight-related emissions by operating new, ultra-modern jet aircraft equipped with the latest engines, wings and avionic design technologies, making them leaders in their respective aircraft categories for efficient flying These advanced capabilities allow ACEs aircraft to operate at very high altitudes and consume less fuel These advanced aircraft also fly optimal routes, which have shorter distances between world destinations, saving fuel and ultimately the release of GHGs In addition, ACE reports its GHG emissions data and related activities to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an independent, not-for-profit organization that gathers and scores primary corporate carbon emissions information for thousands of businesses around the world In 2014, ACEs 2013 submission to the CDP resulted in a disclosure score of 93 and a performance score of B

(Hereinafter referred to as the Companies)

Please note that the above list of companies have approximately 20% of their total writings in Property and the remaining 80% of their total writings are for lines other than property; thus the primary business focus is on liability lines of insurance Additionally the companies write almost entirely commercial lines risks rather than personal lines risks 

Berkley Life and Health Insurance Company (Berkley Life) writes health insurance and reinsurance in four primary areas: medical stop loss, managed care, special risk and group captive Historically we have not experienced any increase in losses as a result of natural catastrophes such as hurricane, flood or tornado, nor do we currently anticipate this to occur in the future Neither the management of Berkley Life nor the Berkley Group Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team has identified any link between loss frequency and / or severity in these niche health insurance products written by Berkley Life and natural catastrophes such as hurricane, tornado, flood, drought or wildfire Consequently although Berkley Life has full access to the Berkley Groups research into the potential impact of climate change, it is not currently an issue for Berkley Life from an insured loss perspective 
Survey Question 1: Yes, the Companies do the following: 
 Recycling: Our Companies participate in programs that encourage the recycling of paper, bottles and cans, as well as cardboards and plastics, as well as ink cartridges Document destruction bins and a pick-up service are used by nearly all offices within the Group that allow for proper destruction of paper files This service picks up, shreds, and recycles the paper in those destruction bins so that trees are preserved within the environment 
Additionally, some offices have drop off bins for employees wishing to donate things such as eyeglasses, batteries, and old cell phones Those companies then donate those items to organizations that are able to re-use the recycled items Office supplies are recycled by one company and then donated to an organization that provides low cost/free supplies to teachers who have a need for classroom items Several office locations recycle used computer equipment when possible and/or refurbish and donate equipment in working condition to local charitable organizations that are in need of computer equipment 
The Companies continually strive to promote a greener environment by converting to paperless as much as possible and imaging paper files into electronic documents More frequently, offices are beginning to remind email recipients under the signature line of their email to consider the environment before printing to conserve paper One office has placed codes on internal printers to monitor and discourage unnecessary printing and ensure that when printing is required, its being done in the most efficient format and to the most efficient printer for a given print job 
Email and phone communication, both with internal and external customers (namely policyholders) is encouraged to reduce the Companies carbon footprint and cut down on printed hard copy communications One example of this conservation of paper to protect the environment is the setting up of claims electronically via telephone or email Another office is converting the delivery of marketing materials to electronic format rather than in paper format In most offices, whiteboards and digital projectors are installed in meeting rooms so that the amount of paper consumed is reduced when meetings are held 
One example of the Companies demonstrating their care for the environment occurred when their office building was under construction Instead of purchasing brand new fixtures and furnishings, they reused some materials such as doors, window treatments, light fixtures and ceiling grid from the previous building to save on cost and to reduce the amount of waste that they were putting in the landfill As far as cleaning materials for our offices buildings are concerned, the selection of cleaning materials within some of the locations is carefully considered and a large portion of the cleaning products used in certain offices are either environmentally safe cleaning products and/or are white vinegar based 

 Water & Conservation: Companies closely monitor outdoor irrigation, some to an extent that sensors determine whether or not the grounds actually need water based on the amount of rainfall that the area has seen Others are set on timers and only run during specific, set times to provide for a more predictable monthly water bill In addition, the setting of timers to determine watering schedule allows for the building grounds to be watered with optimum efficiency, thereby reducing over-watering Internally, certain buildings have a reverse osmosis system installed that provides filtered water to employees and is intended to promote the use of thermos/hard plastic water bottles and cut down on the amount of trash/recycling One of the Companies has low consumption water closets installed in all of the bathrooms to further reduce the amount of water used

 Lighting: Some Company buildings are currently in process of or already are Energy Star Rated Some have converted incandescent lighting to fluorescent, low energy lighting Lighting of buildings at most office locations is set for regularly scheduled business hours and is of limited use on nights and weekends In addition, employees are encouraged to turn lights off in areas not in use and reminders are placed in those areas to encourage employees to conserve energy when possible In some offices, motion activated sensors have been installed for lighting so that energy is automatically conserved when an area is not being used Externally, parking garage lighting is also set on a timer schedule and only provides lighting during scheduled hours of the day, rather than continuously

 Heating and Cooling: Companies monitor usage of heating and cooling systems and many set heat pumps back at night and during non-business hours to conserve energy usage when employees are not there When employees are in the building, heat and cooling system temperatures are closely monitored using a computerized environment with limited access, and systems run only when necessary rather than continuously On nights and weekends, heating and cooling can be limited to areas where an employee is based and is on a timer scheduled system Having areas on a timer system eliminates the need to heat or cool an entire building for an individual during non-standard business hours 
Regular, scheduled preventative maintenance is done on heating and cooling systems to ensure optimum efficiency and cut down on any possible wasted energy (this includes regular changing of air filters, etc) Additionally, one of the Companies has 2 HVAC chiller systems that are environmentally friendly and operate during the summer months to cut down on humidity within the building and aid in keeping the energy exertion of the air conditioning to a lower level Some offices either have or are in the process of replacing older heat pumps with newer, more energy efficient units to further reduce energy consumption 

 Technology: Company intranet pages and emails are encouraged as a main source of communication iPads are available to some employees at a few of the offices that help to minimize the need to print reports and materials for meetings with internal and external customers Additionally, the use of social media sites (Twitter and LinkedIn) provides an opportunity to communicate information electronically without the need for printing hard copies IT, at one location, is in process of enhancing their technology by converting computer monitors from LCD to LED and replacing older computer systems with more up to date, energy efficient models In addition, at one location plans are in place to convert the server room to a more energy efficient area that would promote less usage of cooling systems Other companies within the Group share an office location and a data center that allows for them to consolidate the amount of energy and resources used 

Increasingly offices are installing power shut offs on all desk computer systems to further save on energy during non-standard business hours and weekends Some employees have the capability to access the office remotely to curtail transportation to and from the office Video/web conferencing is also becoming more common amongst offices to reduce the frequency of travel, but still allow individuals to meet on work-related topics as required 

 Transportation: Carpooling has been adopted by a number of the offices as a means to cut down on the number of cars on the road and reduce emissions released by vehicles To promote use of public transit to get to and from work, one office offers an employer sponsored public transit pass system to encourage continued use of public transportation A particular office has a designated bicycle storage facility within their office building to promote the use of greener means of transportation to and from work, whether that be biking to work or using public transportation and then biking to the office

An example of a company incentivizing employees to reduce their carbon footprint is through a Trip Reduction Program that rewards employees who carpool the majority of each work week Those employees, in turn, get placed into a drawing for a monthly prize amongst the members that participate in the program

Telecommuting is available to some departments and office locations The ability to work from home allows for individuals to remote in and work from their home, to save fuel costs, reduce the number of cars on the road and also cut down on the emissions released into the air by vehicles As another means of reducing emissions and fuel costs, a few of the office locations have company cars that are either hybrid and/or get 30+ mpg A second method of cutting down on daily commutes is achieved by offices positioning themselves or relocating to areas where most staff can easily use public transport to get to work, rather than driving personal vehicles 
Other Companies within the Berkley organization are also beginning to open up satellite office(s) that allow Berkley employees located in nearby vicinities to share an office space and also cut down travel time significantly for employees who may live closer to the satellite office than to the home office of the company for which they are employed An alternative thats offered by some companies is allowing employees to work flexible hours so that employees may avoid commuting during high traffic times to and from work"	0	"R Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation and the ultimate controlling parent (""Berkley"") Berkley Insurance Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Signet Star Holdings, Inc, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkley The following companies, which only represents a portion of insurers that are subsidiaries of Berkley, were requested to provide a response to the Insurer Climate Risk Survey (""Survey"") by one or more of the following: California Department of Insurance, Connecticut Insurance Department, Illinois Department of Insurance, Maryland Insurance Administration, Minnesota Department of Commerce, New Mexico Office of Superintendent of Insurance, New York Department of Financial Services and or the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner:

The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting (through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting Framework) and engagement 
Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defence industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, and excludes companies and countries if they do not meet the pre-defined criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis
As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular integration of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we started to measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 
1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy 

2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2017, approximately 43% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 95% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 
Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:

Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy

Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2017, p 137f

In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 22% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments The total energy consumption surface in accordance with the MINERGIE® standard was 82'497 m2in Q2 2018 
Since 2015, Swiss Re has also invested in the US real estate market The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities

Swiss Re's research on the economics of climate adaptation (ECA) has a specific focus on the impact of climate change on local economies ECA studies quantify todays climate risks, the potential increase of populations and assets at risk due to economic development, plus the additional risk posed by climate change, with a time horizon of up to 30 years In a second step, our studies identify cost-effective measures to minimize and adapt to these risks In this way, ECA studies provide decision makers with important information needed to integrate climate adaptation with economic development, paving the way for sustainable growth

"	4	"In general, Zurich's Investment Policy pursues simultaneously the goals of security and profitability of the assets in which funds are invested to
* ensure sufficient liquid funding for all future commitments; and
* generate adequate financial return in the form of investment income and capital appreciation
In general, Zurich's Investment Policy is designed to take careful consideration of several factors, including but not limited to
* the economic risk and reward tradeoff of an investment, including any risks and opportunities related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, and how that investment affects the economic risk and reward tradeoff of the entire investment portfolio taken in the context of Zurich's liabilities;
* compliance with applicable rules and regulations;
* compliance with internal risk management policies and constraints;
* the accounting treatment of the investment;
* the impact of the investment, if any, on federal, state and local taxes;
* the impact of the investment on regulatory and accounting solvency measures;
* the liquidity or marketability of the investment taken in the context of liquidity needs stemming from Zurich's liabilities; and
* any potential operational or reputational risks involved in making the investment
Zurich is committed to responsible investment in achieving its investment objectives, and responsible investment practices form an integral part of Zurich's Investment Policy
Zurich is making continued progress in integrating ESG factors, including climate change, into security and asset selection processes across its investment portfolio Zurich is also thoroughly assessing responsible investment practices of its asset managers as part of its manager selection and monitoring processes
In addition to Zurich's established 'business-as-usual' ESG integration practices we have launched, during 2017:
* Worked with a variety of partner organizations on methodologies that allow for comprehensive assessment of exposure to physical and transition climate risk for equities, corporate bonds, real estate and infrastructure investments
* Conducted an in-depth analysis of portfolio carbon footprint
* Updated our macroeconomic climate risk scenarios
* Actively voted on shareholder resolutions regarding climate change disclosures or actions of investee companies
* Published Zurich's climate change investment strategy
* Committed to divest equity and run off fixed income investments from companies that generate >50% of their revenues from thermal coal mining or use >50% of coal in their energy generation mix by the end of 2018

Environmental Sustainability: As a leader in social responsibility, we are employing innovation and determination to move the sustainability needle We optimized our energy performance and reduced our energy consumption across the Aetna-owned portfolio of facilities in 2012 and 2013, excluding the Coventry Health Care properties we acquired last year We saved more than 178 million kilowatt hours across the enterprise from 2011 to 2013  a 156 percent reduction over 2 years

The lynchpin of this effort is our Sustainable Data Center and Technology initiative Recognized by the Computerworld Honors Program in 2013 for using information technology to promote positive social and economic change, our green data center project enables 20 percent greater operating efficiency  adding at least a decade of life to our data centers

We also continue to invest in renewable energy, virtually doubling our annual production of electricity in 2013 to 465,000 kwh with the addition of solar panels to a second Aetna-owned facility

Building on our foundational strengths, we will continue to help improve the quality of life for the American s and people across the globe for a more sustainable future

" Climate change may impact the frequency and/or severity of hurricanes, tropical cyclones, tornadoes and hail MetLifes climate change risks come from potential physical climate change and weather-related events that could have an impact on MetLifes internal operations or the nature of our financial services products  Both extreme climate change events and individual weather-related occurrences could disrupt our global offices or impact the financial needs of MetLifes customers  MetLife is a global company and has many of its offices and business functions serving in regions that are more vulnerable to extreme weather-related events, including Asia (MetLife has a strong presence in India and Japan), USA (especially the states on the east coast) and Africa MetLife also reviews and evaluates all relevant potential risks and exposures when negotiating and renewing our directors and officers liability and commercial general liability policies

Climate change is expected to have its largest impact on the homeowners line of business The Company reviews the monthly potential loss impact of hurricanes, tornadoes, and hail  For hurricanes, the Company utilizes three third party catastrophe models to analyze potential net losses across five hurricane zones in the United States The Companys exposure data is updated annually, but monitored monthly  The catastrophe models are typically revised each year, but many times the changes are minor  When a new version of a model with significant changes is released, the Company re-runs its exposure data as soon as practicably possible, vets the results for reasonability and incorporates the revised model results once the reasonability test is satisfied  The reasonability test includes a discussion with the modeling company or MetLifes broker about what changed and what are the expected impacts  The model results are used to develop an average annual hurricane provision for each zip code and shared with the Pricing Department to be incorporated into the rates  

The Company also manages its Probable Maximum Loss (PML) for each of the five hurricane regions  Each year the number of sales in the coastal areas of hurricane prone states to keep the PMLs stable is calculated  Actual sales in those areas are monitored in relation to the amount needed to keep the PMLs stable  States with significant deviations are reviewed on a case by case basis to determine the reason and best solution for the deviation

To mitigate the impact of large hurricane losses, the Company implemented mandatory hurricane wind deductibles, where allowed, in most states from Texas to Maine ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the state and the area within the state  The Company also excludes wind coverage in the more vulnerable hurricane areas of some states where allowed 

Another main source of physical climate change risk to MetLifes business operations comes from possible precipitation extremes and droughts, which could have an impact on MetLifes internal operations or the nature of our financial services products  Both extreme climate change events and individual weather-related occurrences have the potential to disrupt global offices or impact the financial needs of our customers, including increased claims from natural disasters and other catastrophes MetLife operates in nearly 50 countries across the globe, in three regions: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and Asia Each region and local office is vulnerable to precipitation extremes and droughts

These potential losses include destruction of our facilities and the disruption of services to our customers, as well as financial losses due to weather-related auto and homeowner insurance claims  Additional financial implications include potential increased operational cost and financial risks relating to loan defaults of agricultural losses

Beyond the direct potential physical effects of climate change, including increasing temperatures, precipitation extremes, droughts, natural disasters and other catastrophic weather events, MetLife also recognizes the indirect risks associated with climate change For example, MetLife recognizes that failing to reduce its own emissions could negatively impact its brand reputation, and thus strives to reduce its emissions levels Addressing climate change can also provide MetLife with a strategic advantage over its competitors  MetLife increasingly embraces emerging technologies and green products, factoring in climate change for business strategies, and risk management procedures to remain financially and operationally sound  The Company also acknowledges that increasing temperatures could impact employee health, could drive new legislation that could impact business, and could alter the overall global economy

" Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Groups Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting  and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope 

Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis

As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Res commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity  of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015 
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments 
ESG considerations per asset class: 

1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy
 
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
 


Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing  
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:
Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy
Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or stranded over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f
We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
 
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's Green Bond Principles As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Banks recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure 
Direct private equity investment professionals consider ESG issues when reviewing new Private Equity investment opportunities and are responsible to closely monitor the portfolio of direct private equity investments with respect to ESG issues They actively engage with the management team of the portfolio companies whenever it is deemed necessary in line with Swiss Re's duty as significant minority shareholder
New investments are only made into Private Equity funds that adhere to ESG guidelines and exclusion lists, such as thermal coal exclusions ESG considerations are systematically included to the Investment Memorandum ESG considerations at investee company level are reviewed and discussed as part of an annual deep dive analysis and meeting This includes an update on any changes based on discussions and information received from investee companies' management teams
In Swiss Re's real estate investments, sustainability criteria play an essential role We apply ambitious sustainability standards For projects in Switzerland, the applicable criteria are defined in the Energy Mission Statement of Swiss Re This stipulates that all new buildings need to conform to the MINERGIE standard (wwwminergiech), a Swiss quality label specifying high levels of energy efficiency and superior user comfort When an existing building is due for renovation, this standard applies whenever it is feasible from an architectural, technical and financial point of view In Q2 2018, the combined value of our MINERGIE®-certified buildings reached USD 04 billion, or 23% of our Swiss portfolio of direct real estate investments  Furthermore, we also invest in the US, UK and Australian real estate markets, reaching a total size of USD 17 billion by the end of 2018
The investment managers approach to sustainability includes GreenGuide: Sustainable Property Operations, a best practice guideline for sustainable and efficient real estate operations; ULI GreenPrint Foundation, a global environmental management platform; and LEED Certification from the US Green Building Council The US portfolio is also benchmarked against GRESB, a relative benchmark reliant on performance of all submitting entities The portfolio outperformed the GRESB average of 68/100 with a score of 78/100 
"	4	"Therefore, it is important that we also take a long-term view on the risk factors that may have an adverse impact on our portfolio, which includes climate change Hence, sustainability and climate change are essential topics for us Our asset management is committed to sustainability and has a well-defined framework which considers ESG criteria, consistently with the Group's Code of Conduct The overall responsibility for responsible investing lies with the Group Chief Investment Officer, supported by the Head Responsible Investing, and the Asset Management Investment Committee Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Board, formed by representatives of all investment units, legal, compliance and risk management, reports on responsible investment activities in the various investment units, develops and reviews improvement ideas, shares knowledge and monitors implementation progress
The Group Asset Management Standard on Responsible Investments (our internal policy) defines our commitment to sustainability The document outlines the principles for all responsible investing activities which include asset classes, investment manager selection, portfolio monitoring and reporting, voting and engagement (the last two items through the reference to the Swiss Re Voting and Engagement Standard) Swiss Re's strong commitment to sustainability is also defined in our Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework This framework is applied to the entire investment portfolio, and enables us to identify and analyse potential ESG risks within an investment The framework consists of two umbrella policies on human rights and environmental protection, and seven policies on sensitive sectors or issues: the defense industry; oil and gas (including oil sands); mining; dams; animal testing; forestry and logging; pulp & paper and oil palm; and nuclear weapons proliferation Each policy contains a number of predefined criteria and qualitative standards that may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope
Our Asset Management unit applies all mentioned criteria to our investment assets, which may lead to the exclusion of a company or a country from our investment scope if they do not meet these criteria and qualitative standards Our exclusion list is reviewed on a regular basis
As a long-term investor, we consider ESG criteria that may have an adverse impact on the sustainable value of our portfolio, such as climate risk and pollution & waste For the systematic and regular assessment of such ESG criteria, we apply sustainability ratings to our investment portfolio Furthermore, based on Swiss Re's commitment to support the transition to a low-carbon environment, we measure the weighted average carbon intensity of our listed equities and credit portfolio on a regular basis since the end of 2015
In 2017, Swiss Re's Asset Management received the highest rating for its responsible investment approach (""Strategy & Governance"") as well as for the ""Manager Seclection, Appointment and Monitoring"" section Swiss Re scores among the top 15% of all signatories of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investments
ESG considerations per asset class:
1) Government bonds
Our largest holding within rates products are government bonds (incl agency) At country level, we have implemented a concept of minimum ESG rating standards considering political risk, human rights, and environmental factors that affect the resilience of countries as part of our ESG practice Investments in government bonds hold an ESG rating of BB or better The detailed information is provided by a specialised research company Assessment results guide our responsible investment decisions to ensure the targeted ESG quality of our government bond portfolio This portfolio is screened against such ESG criteria considerations on a monthly basis The sustainability rating is of particular relevance from the perspective of climate change as it measures not only the overall social and governance situation in a country but also its environmental aspects This allows us to consider environmental management in any country in our investment strategy
2) Credit products, listed equities, private equity and real estate
At the end of 2018, approximately 46% of our investment portfolio was managed externally This portfolio comprises mainly credit products, equities and hedge funds PRI signatories manage more than 96% of these assets We look at ESG integration primarily from the viewpoint of generating sustainable long-term returns, which aligns well with our focus on a high-quality investment portfolio As part of our active risk management, we are therefore adopting ESG-based benchmarks in our actively managed credit and listed equity portfolios Active credit mandates are benchmarked against Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Corporate Sustainability indices and listed equities are benchmarked against MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders indices, with portfolio managers assessed against outperformance as well as ESG quality of the portfolio
Furthermore, all of our external asset managers have contractual provisions with Swiss Re that specifically relate to responsible investing
We work closely with the external managers to ensure they consider ESG aspects in their investment processes Before external managers are appointed, we perform thorough due diligence to confirm their compliance with our responsible investment principles This includes ESG considerations in investment decisions and monitoring, as well as a review of the managers' commitment to responsible investing After being mandated, the managers' individual performances are monitored in line with our Responsible Investment Policy and measured against ESG-related benchmarks The managers are required to report regularly on their responsible investment activities
For more systematic and regular monitoring of the actual integration of ESG criteria into our externally managed portfolio, we have engaged the services of a leading ESG research company We conduct in-depth assessments based on ratings provided by them on a regular basis to analyse the quality of the portfolio and to gain further insight into ESG risk exposures We assess the portfolio on the following criteria that are built-up by the factors mentioned below:
Environmental: Climate Change, Natural Resources Use, Waste Management and Environmental Opportunities;
Social: Human Capital, Product Safety, Social Opportunities;
Governance: Corporate Governance, Business Ethics, Government & Public Policy
Results are used to better understand the implications of incorporating ESG considerations into our investment decision-making process and to further improve the quality of our investment portfolio
In 2016, we started to divest from companies that generate 30% or more of their revenues from thermal coal mining or that use at least 30% thermal coal for power generation The decision was taken to mitigate the risk of coal related assets becoming devalued or ""stranded"" over the long-term The decision resulted in over USD 13 billion divestments and a significant decrease in carbon intensities in both the credit and the listed equity portfolios For more information, please see Swiss Re's Annual Report 2018, p 174f
We recently also developed and implemented a policy covering mining companies that produce 20m tons of coal per year or more, and existing power generation capacity with installed coal-fire capacity of at least 10 GW, which has not yet been publicly stated
Furthermore, we actively contribute to a low carbon economy by investing in the growing SSA (sovereigns, supranational and agencies) green bond market, primarily relying on ICMA's ""Green Bond Principles"" As part of our commitment to sustainability, we also invest in green bonds in our credit mandates, as well as renewables and social infrastructure in our infrastructure private debt mandates Debt raised through green bonds is used to finance environmental responsible projects that provide clear benefits from that perspective In 2018, we achieved our target of having a green bond portfolio worth at least USD 15 billion Swiss Re is committed to act as an advocate of long-term investments in infrastructure, as reflected by collaborating with, and advising, the World Bank's recently established Global Infrastructure Facility Infrastructure debt is an attractive asset class for a long-term investor like Swiss Re Improving energy efficiency and developing low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy sources, are critical to reducing carbon emissions and securing future energy supplies Renewables and social infrastructure investments are therefore the largest sub-sector in our infrastructure mandate with 21% in renewable energy and 23% in social infrastructure
Direct private equity investment professionals consider ESG issues when reviewing new Private Equity investment opportunities and are responsible to closely monitor the portfolio of direct private equity investments with respect to ESG issues They actively engage with the management team of the portfolio companies whenever it is deemed necessary in line with Swiss Re's duty as significant minority shareholder
New investments are only made into Private Equity funds that adhere to ESG guidelines and exclusion lists, such as thermal coal exclusions ESG considerations are systematically included to the Investment Memorandum ESG considerations at investee company level are reviewed and discussed as part of an annual deep dive analysis and meeting This includes an update on any changes based on discussions and information received from investee companies' management teams

"  While recent trends appear to be sufficient to predict near-term risk, we also incorporate scientific consensus of climate research to better understand long-term possibilities

" and Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada With the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, all of the directors are independent, according to the Director Independence Policy The RCRC is responsible at the Board level for the oversight of climate-related risks and broadly environmental risks, through the oversight of the management of current and emerging risks enterprise-wide, and of the risk management function as stated in the RCRC Charter The RCRC ensures processes and controls are designed to identify and effectively manage the significant risks, including climate-related risks, to which Sun Life is exposed and has sufficient capital to underpin those risks The RCRC regularly monitors Sun Lifes risk profile to ensure it is within the agreed risk appetite and that our capital position is in compliance with regulatory capital requirements It also monitors and recommends to the Board for approval, the specific risk limits allocated to the businesses and the annual Capital Plan

The Risk Management Framework (RMF) sets out the overarching framework for the management of risk across the enterprise and is a multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process It sets out all the components of our risk programs and explains how they operate together in support of the business The RMF prescribes a comprehensive set of protocols and programs that need to be followed in conducting business activities The risks that arise when providing products and services to Clients, which are in line with our purpose to help our Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives, should be managed within these protocols and programs We also face risks in formulating our business strategy and business objectives, in carrying out our business activities in the pursuit of our strategy and objectives, and from external factors such as changes in the economic, political and regulatory environments Effective risk management is critical to the overall profitability, competitive market positioning and long-term financial viability of the Company While all risk cannot necessarily be eliminated, the RMF seeks to ensure that risks to a business undertaking are appropriately managed to achieve the Companys business objectives over time and are not expected to exceed the pre-established boundaries for risk taking RMF elements include risk governance, risk universe, risk appetite and risk management policies The RMF sets out the key risk management process  identification, measurement, management, monitoring and reporting It covers all risks, grouped into six categories: credit, market, insurance, business and strategic, operational and liquidity risks This broad range of risks includes environmental risks which we define as the possibility of loss from environmental or social concerns related to Sun Life's strategic, financial, operational and reputational value This includes physical impacts of climate change and impacts of the transition to a lower-carbon economy, emerging environmental regulations, and risks associated with management and operation of company-owned or managed real estate Our Key Risk Process highlights the need for Sun Life Business Groups to identify key strategic risks (including climate-related risks) that will impact their area within the Strategic Plan horizon and provide actions to mitigate them In order to assess the key risks, management documents specific risk drivers that contribute to the risk and assesses the probability and severity of the risks over a three-year period The severity takes into account financial and non-financial impacts The financial impacts are based on our Strategic Plan forecast The non-financial impacts consider items such as regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage
 Key risks, including environmental risks as described above, are managed and monitored through quarterly updates on management actions and key risk indicators Significant changes in risk levels are reported to the Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board quarterly In alignment with ERC meetings throughout the year, top and emerging risks are identified and assessed quarterly For example, in Feb 2020 we presented to the ERC the Emerging and Top Risks report, which discussed the World Economic Forums Global Risk Report profiling the top five emerging risks as Environmental Risks and how Central banks, regulators and investors are increasing their focus on ESG issues, particularly climate change Annually, Sun Life updates business continuity plans for opportunities to better integrate evolving climate-related risks, such as increased intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding

Each of Sun Life's businesses takes a unique approach to identifying and assessing climate-related risk based on the underlying asset management business and the asset classes they invest in

SLC Management is our institutional asset manager that offers investors traditional, alternative and yield-oriented investment solutions across public and private fixed income markets, as well as global real estate equity and debt SLC's real estate equity and debt division is BentallGreenOak

Through SLC Management's key risk identification process under the Risk Management Framework outlined above, SLC  has identified investment performance as a key risk for its business Critical to successfully managing this risk is SLCs ESG Plus program, which includes the identification and management of non-financial risks including climate change Progress and initiatives are reviewed monthly by the SLC Sustainable Investing Council

Within SLC Management, working teams including asset class leaders and other members of the investment teams conduct ESG Plus Studies and create ESG Plus Analysis Modules for implementation across all asset classes 

The Sustainable Investing Council decides which industries and sectors urgently require deeper analysis through an ESG Plus Study The results of the study are documented in a formal ESG Plus Analysis Module This analysis module includes recommended sustainability metrics for future consideration, but does not necessarily prescribe or restrict the investment decisions of portfolio managers The Modules are reviewed at least annually for refinement The Council meets with working teams to discuss their study findings, approve the analysis modules, and share the recommendations across all asset classes SLC Management incorporates a number of different analyses into its assessment of climate risks through both standalone analysis of physical risks by geographic region and through the assessment of carbon transition risks depending on asset class Through consistent industry-level analysis, SLCs teams evaluate the impact of climate change issues on a company's future operations Where climate risks are deemed material for an asset, SLC would develop key metrics for evaluating climate risks, revisiting the methodology at least annually

SLC Managements process analyzes quantifiable ESG concerns and combines this with a heightened awareness of non-financial risks, which are often harder to quantify and continually evolve SLC requires all investments to undergo analysis on the relevant ESG factors and the analysts incorporate those findings into their recommendations This applies to our public and private asset class portfolios

In conducting its real estate module in 2019, climate change risks, where deemed to be material, were considered as a part of SLCs final module for assessing the risk of a property investment SLC considers climate risk to manifest itself in two key ways: 1) physical risks due to extreme weather events (both chronic and acute events) and 2) carbon transition risks, which includes the government policy response In conducting this assessment, SLC also considered a broad range of other climate-related impacts including energy use, water and waste practices at the site


Within our BentallGreenOak real estate portfolio, we have a robust approach to energy efficiency and GHG reductions through target setting and energy efficiency training programs By making smart and timely upgrades to existing buildings, BentallGreenOak reduces environmental impacts and improves efficiency BentallGreenOak tracks and analyzes energy data to identify conservation opportunities, strategically focus on capital improvements and innovation, and drive performance BentallGreenOak launched an annual benchmarking survey to track property-level sustainability data, measure performance against global best practices, find opportunities for improvement and enhance client reporting The survey pinpoints next steps that inform budget decisions to improve sustainability outcomes in the following areas: energy, water, waste, tenant engagement, certification, health and well-being and innovation Extreme weather events affect building costs and performance Through strategic planning that assesses critical vulnerabilities to the built environment, BentallGreenOak seeks to proactively address climate risks at the property and portfolio levels and communicate insights to its tenants and investors

As a signatory to the United Nations supported Principles of Responsible Investments (""PRI""), BGO has committed to review Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") risks for all of new and existing investments To manage climate related risks, BGO considers - when relevant - any environmental or climate-related risks and documents those risks that may occur over the investment horizon Within the Mortgage portfolio, BGO has sought opportunities to divest from properties in high risk flood and earthquake zones, as well as require tenants to carry additional flood and earthquake insurance where appropriate However, we see our portfolio primarily as a climate-related opportunity as we hold over $19 billion in investments that are sustainable and/or ""green""

Climate change has serious implications for buildings and cities Sun Lifes Corporate Real Estate group together with our building owners and property managers proactively examines ways to improve the ability of our buildings to withstand the effects of climate change Were addressing the physical risks of climate change to our properties, and we continue to research and evaluate ways to adapt our buildings Our goal is to improve preparedness and better withstand extreme weather events We assess the potential effects of climate change related hazards on our office locations and real estate investment properties These hazards include tornadoes, flash floods, ice storms and coastline flooding Each year, we update our business continuity plans to build in current and developing climate risks We continue to improve the efficiency of our resource, energy and water use We have established sustainability design standards for our offices and we use a sustainability scorecard to assess a site before entering a lease

Stress testing is an important risk management tool that tests the resiliency of Sun Life under extreme scenarios In 2020, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries replaced DCAT with Financial Condition Testing (FCT) FCT, similar to DCAT, will continue to act as a stress testing technique for Sun Life FCT is conducted annually and the objective is to identify possible threats to Sun Lifes financial position, over a 3 to5 year projection period, and to identify actions to mitigate the impact if the threats were to occur In 2018 and 2019, we developed and implemented a Climate Change scenario  The scenario analysis included a comprehensive review of our risk exposures to climate change This included risk exposures for the life and health insurance businesses, as well as the impact on investments First order impacts included the damage to real estate assets in high-risk flood areas These include both assets owned directly and mortgage collateral Second order impacts were driven by the transition out of carbon intensive businesses, resulting in devalued assets in these sectors The Climate Change scenario helps us progress our understanding of some of the economic risks, as well as potential responses and mitigating actions

The 2019 Climate Change scenario showed significant potential second order impacts from the devaluation of assets, with the regulatory capital ratio remaining above operating targets The non-linear nature of climate change risk, coupled with the uncertainty in the time horizon, scale, and scope of risk, make this a critically important issue for Sun Lifes risk management Based on the results, the Appointed Actuary recommended that the company develop climate change investment risk measures and corresponding risk limits to track, report, and manage Sun Life exposures The report on the results and recommendations were signed off by the Appointed Actuary, presented to the RCRC, and filed with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Management actions were taken for the recommendations For example, the Climate Change scenario was revisited in 2019, with heightened stresses to further increase awareness of this important emerging risk as recommended in the 2018 DCAT

activities includes various Group Executive Committee members and an annual presentation
on Swiss Re's climate change strategy and activities is made to the Board of Director's
Chairman's and Governance Committee On a day-to-day basis the topic is managed by the
Global Head of Sustainability He and his team are responsible for implementing Swiss Re's
climate change strategy and for coordinating the associated activities In addition, they act as the central point of communication for all climate-related inquiries both from within and outside the company On an operational basis the potential impacts of severe weather on our 60 office locations are assessed by the Safety, Security and Business Continuity Management unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive company-wide Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local Safety and Security Officer, Business Continuity Manager and an Incident Management/Business Continuity Team in place

Understanding the implications of climate change is important to the company and is a key
component of our business and long-term risk management strategy We therefore actively
promote and engage in research on climate related risks and incorporate key findings into
our risk management processes This knowledge informs our business decisions and
supports the development of innovative insurance solutions to mitigate or adapt to climate
change and severe weather impacts To foster greater risk awareness of climate change, we
engage in dialogue with governments, corporations, civil society and other stakeholders, in addition to taking measures to reduce our own carbon footprint For example in 2013 Swiss Re presented to the US Senate Bicameral Taskforce on Climate Change Swiss Re systematically assesses climate related risk (physical, regulatory, reputation, etc)
as part of our risk management and underwriting process Risks such as potential losses
from climate litigation in the US are monitored on a quarterly basis The company
supplements risk assessment with research into climate change and its economic impact

This process is led by three units: Sustainability & Political Risk Management, Catastrophe Perils, and Emerging Risk Management More details on these units can be found in question 3

Swiss Re also invests considerable resources to explore how the future risk landscape as
well as how related business opportunities may develop For example, the company has
recently published reports on shaping climate resilient development, a ranking of cities
under threat from natural catastrophes including weather related catastrophes, the risks in solar and wind energy and the risks and opportunities of future energy scenarios:

Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment
process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with
respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process

The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including
climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer which outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document
describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and
responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the
management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets

Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk
Framework (see additional information linked below) which comprises of country
exclusions, company exclusions and policies covering eight sectors including environmental
considerations which are applied consistently across the re/insurance and investment
activities of the Group

The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Asset Management Executive Team, chaired by the Group Chief Investment Officer
Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group connects our risk management, investment and
sustainability experts This Group-wide platform for coordination and knowledge sharing
ensures that our overall commitment to responsible investments is reflected in our day-today activities

Chairman's and Governance Committee On a day-to-day basis the topic is managed by the
Global Head of Sustainability He and his team are responsible for implementing Swiss Re's
climate change strategy and for coordinating the associated activities In addition, they act as the central point of communication for all climate-related inquiries both from within and outside the company On an operational basis the potential impacts of severe weather on our 60 office locations are assessed by the Safety, Security and Business Continuity Management unit Swiss Re operates a comprehensive company-wide Operational Risk and Business Continuity Management system Each location has a local Safety and Security Officer, Business Continuity Manager and an Incident Management/Business Continuity Team in place
Understanding the implications of climate change is important to the company and is a key
component of our business and long-term risk management strategy We therefore actively
promote and engage in research on climate related risks and incorporate key findings into
our risk management processes This knowledge informs our business decisions and
supports the development of innovative insurance solutions to mitigate or adapt to climate
change and severe weather impacts To foster greater risk awareness of climate change, we
engage in dialogue with governments, corporations, civil society and other stakeholders, in addition to taking measures to reduce our own carbon footprint For example in 2013 Swiss Re presented to the US Senate Bicameral Taskforce on Climate Change Swiss Re systematically assesses climate related risk (physical, regulatory, reputation, etc)
as part of our risk management and underwriting process Risks such as potential losses
from climate litigation in the US are monitored on a quarterly basis The company
supplements risk assessment with research into climate change and its economic impact
This process is led by three units: Sustainability & Political Risk Management, Catastrophe Perils, and Emerging Risk Management More details on these units can be found in question 3
Swiss Re also invests considerable resources to explore how the future risk landscape as
well as how related business opportunities may develop For example, the company has
recently published reports on shaping climate resilient development, a ranking of cities
under threat from natural catastrophes including weather related catastrophes, the risks in solar and wind energy and the risks and opportunities of future energy scenarios:

For further details of our management of climate risk, please see question 3
Swiss Re is committed to invest its assets in a responsible manner which is reflected by the integration of environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") criteria in our investment
process To that end, roles and responsibilities of the different investment units with
respect to responsible investing activities have been defined, in particular for the integration of ESG considerations in the investment process
The key document with regard to responsible investment and ESG considerations, including
climate change is the Responsible Investment Policy This policy is a Group policy issued by the Group Chief Investment Officer which outlines the ESG business policy and approach to sustainability in the management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets This document
describes the Responsible Investment Framework, Principles and corresponding roles and
responsibilities of the different investment units and stakeholders involved in the
management of Swiss Re Group's investment assets
Swiss Re's investment activities are also subject to the company's Sustainability Risk
Framework (see additional information linked below) which comprises of country
exclusions, company exclusions and policies covering eight sectors including environmental
considerations which are applied consistently across the re/insurance and investment
activities of the Group
The overall responsibility to monitor our commitment to responsible investment lies with the Asset Management Executive Team, chaired by the Group Chief Investment Officer
Furthermore, an ESG Advisory Group connects our risk management, investment and
sustainability experts This Group-wide platform for coordination and knowledge sharing
ensures that our overall commitment to responsible investments is reflected in our day-today activities
Swiss Re actively engages in discussion on environmental, social and governance issues in
the context of its investments

" As our business evolves to respond to healthcare reform in the United States  through integrated healthcare delivery and operational cost reductions  we are transforming our business strategy to be more agile and responsive to current healthcare trends For example: strategically selecting and managing our changing real estate portfolio of office properties and associated services (such as data centers), expanding our number of medical clinics, and other new facility concepts are core to our success in responding to changing market demands and to the impacts of climate change We have invested staff resources and capital funds to manage risks and opportunities presented by the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy and to improve building energy efficiency 

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2018 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $945,800 In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We also partnered with a local electric company to participate in a Demand Response Program On high-energy use days, Humana curbs our electricity usage by turning off common areas and exterior lighting as well as adjusting back-of-the-house systems and asking employees to turn off any unnecessary power consumption  such as desk lamps Not only does this program reduce demand on the regional electrical grid, but it also raises awareness of sensible energy consumption among our employees  We also installed solar panels and reduced our carbon imprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol  The company provides transparency into this goal, and progress toward it, by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets    Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2016, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems   We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiencythe majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles    To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio  in addition to ENERGY STAR® ratings        In 2016, Cigna had 45 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agencys ENERGY STAR® program  These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next five years

Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)-- Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets    Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail      Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster       Additionally, Cignas Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients

Management methods include the following:    (1) Cignas Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cignas data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol         (2) Cignas critical applications run in hardened sites protected by an emergency generator Weve also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication      (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes     (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk     These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risks potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years

Risk: Reputation-- Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones   Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders

Management methods include the following:   (1) Within our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2017 emissions reduction targets  (2) In 2016, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the second time    (3) The advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives      (4) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility      (5) We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports (using annual Corporate Responsibility Reports using the GRI framework)     We believe that  if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher   However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years

We manage risks associated with energy and fuel costs through (1) our emissions reduction projects and (2) our tracking and monitoring on progress toward energy reduction targets Our Global Real Estate (GRE) team considers this potential risk to inform decision on making on investments in emissions reduction projects In 2016, we completed a series of emissions reduction projects, which include lighting retrofits and enhancements to building automation systems We also manage this risk towards our emphasis on fleet efficiency - Cigna's vehicle fleet exceeds the national average fuel efficiency--the majority of our vehicles are 4-cylinder with alternative fuel (E85) capabilities and hybrid engines, and are classified as partial zero emissions vehicles To manage progress against our 2017 emissions reduction targets, we utilize a proprietary technology data management portal and Utility Insight; a tool to aggregate data for all the sustainability program efforts The Utility tool provides a detailed dashboard of energy cost, consumption and variance across our real estate portfolio - in addition to ENERGY STAR®️ ratings In 2016, Cigna had 45 sites enrolled in the US Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR®️ program These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, but they have reduced this risk's potential magnitude over the next five years
Risk: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons)-- Increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and typhoons, could impact our business services distribution capacities, and may cause damage to physical assets Cigna is committed to excellence in helping our customers enhance and extend their lives and protect their financial security Such a commitment requires that we be prepared to provide our services and offer our products virtually without fail Cigna's Customer Disaster Response also may need to make temporary policy changes, such as waiving various medical requirements, refilling prescriptions and expanding its help line, to proactively address customer service issues and provide personal assistance and support for all affected by a disaster Additionally, Cigna's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) may open its telephone lines to offer members of the impacted communities access to trained clinicians via the telephonic EAP services, regardless if callers have Cigna EAP or not The EAP may also offer immediate access to on-site Critical Incident Services (CISD) support for Cigna clients
Management methods include the following: (1) Cigna's Business Continuity Planning and Data Center Recovery plans sets forth procedures for data recovery, continuation of business functions and the use of supporting technology to recover critical business operations in the event of hurricanes and other unexpected disruptions The plans are updated and documented annually Cigna's data center recovery plans are tested routinely with end-user evaluations of the restored systems as part of the testing protocol (2) Cigna's critical applications run in ""hardened sites"" protected by an emergency generator We've also repatriated core elements of our recovery capability including infrastructure to recover the top prioritized business functions and related computer applications through data and server replication (3) To support clients, we have an online Disaster Resource Center, which is updated to offer resources specific to an area and incident Paired with an intimate knowledge of the provider network, Our Employee Assistance Consultant team area trained to respond quickly in the event of hurricanes (4) We also obtain insurance and make investments to protect our facilities from hurricane risk These management methods have not reduced the likelihood of this risk, however; we believe that these methods have reduced this risk's potential magnitude over the next 1-3 years
Risk: Reputation-- Corporate reputation on performance related to environmental responsibility, particularly on issues related to climate change, is increasingly important to our corporate clients as evidenced by the frequent occurrence of sustainability questions on RFPs for potential corporate clients and RFIs from existing ones Also, our reputation on performance related to climate change issues is becoming increasingly important to our employees, investors and other stakeholders
Management methods include the following: (1) Within our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan, we make continued investments to support our energy strategy and 2017 emissions reduction targets (2) In 2016, we had our Scope 1 and 2 emissions assured for the second time (3) The advancement of our Cigna Connects corporate responsibility framework across our organization supports our Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan by aligning and communicating our Corporate Responsibility initiatives (4) We closely monitor and respond to corporate client (including RFPs and RFIs) and investor requests related to climate change and corporate responsibility (5) We also engage stakeholders and employees to enhance continuous improvement in the implementation of sustainability This includes gathering data and operational experience from programs and sites, disseminating internal scorecards that provide feedback on progress towards goals and completing mandatory and voluntary external reports (using annual Corporate Responsibility Reports using the GRI framework) We believe that - if Cigna did not engage in these current management methods - both the likelihood and magnitude of this risk over the next 1-3 years would be higher However, we acknowledge the importance of continuously improving and responding to evolving stakeholder concerns and expectations to reduce the likelihood and potential magnitude of this risk over the next 4-10 years"	1046	en	mild gibberish

Enterprise Risk Management processes:
As noted in responses to prior questions, we have an Enterprise Risk Management process which looks at all material risks, including risks posed by climate change

Investment Management:
We consider correlated insurance exposures when making bond investment selections to ensure that we are not overly exposed to environmental occurrences in any one geographic territory from both an operational business (underwriting) and investment perspective   

Additionally, we consider the impact of climate change when assessing the financial risk parameters of certain sectors, such as utilities, as well as investment classes such as corporate bonds  

Increasing internal expertise:
We gather input from government agencies, reinsurance partners and industry groups We balance predicting risk with rigorous validation efforts after catastrophic events, auditing losses and comparing them with our pre-event risk assessments to inform future policies and business strategies 

For example, Chubb Loss Control Services conducted a detailed loss analysis to examine the impact of present and future climate change on the frequency and severity of natural hazards such as wind and rain, which led to the development of new risk evaluation guidelines, forms and training for field staff At our Loss Control University, we have expanded training to recognize the unique CleanTech exposures and promote solutions

Catastrophe Modeling:
We evaluate changes in catastrophe risk modeling and the subsequent impact on our existing book We use catastrophe modeling to understand and balance potential perils and risk exposure against our capacity Using catastrophe models, we asses risk scenarios at multiple time scales

Underwriting Management:
We use a risk concentration management tool to monitor/control accumulations of potential losses in geographic areas exposed to weather-related risks and changing weather patterns 

Steps taken to manage exposure to weather-related risk include:
	reviewing the catastrophe model projections; 
	reviewing reinsurance terms and limits; 
	limiting underwriting exposure in peak zones  
	reviewing and modifying our underwriting appetite and/or pricing and 
	encouraging our customers to take loss mitigation steps

Business Continuity Planning:
We have a multi-discipline business continuity planning team to assess and plan for the potential disruption of business operations due to a weather-related event

Engaging Key Constituencies:
As detailed in Question 7, we engage with key constituencies to facilitate their understanding of climate change and its potential impact on our business"	7	"Enterprise Risk Management processes:

Humana also sees our value chain as key constituencies and an extension of our business We engage with suppliers to assess how partnerships can drive collective impact in the areas of sustainability and efficiency Such initiatives have focused on sustainable procurement and increasing waste diversion throughout our supply chain 

Our third release of the Supplier Self-Assessment Sustainability Scorecard engaged more suppliers than the previous year  Responses were facilitated by our availability for one-on-one engagement Via the Scorecard, we collect information from key suppliers regarding their efforts to reduce the environmental impacts associated with their vendor engagement with Humana  This initiative helped us understand the environmental impact of our vendor relationships and set the stage for more robust data collection; findings are reported in our CSR report updates, internal scorecard, and to Humana leadership  We aim to expand this initiative in the future by engaging suppliers that represent the greatest impact As our supply chain program evolves, implementation of the supplier scorecard process will be evaluated on its ability to support our efforts in meeting CDP expectations, assist with sourcing decisions, mitigate risk, and be used as a tracking tool for business reviews  We have strengthened our approach by initiating information requests for larger suppliers during the contract renewal or new vendor engagement process; this underscores our intention to maintain this practice for these suppliers on an annual basis

After setting new emissions reduction and waste diversion targets to ensure continued improvement in 2018 and beyond, we engaged a new facilities management vendor with formalized expectations of their collaborative requirements to ensure attainment of our new targets These expectations were included in the RFP when soliciting bids in an effort to elevate our sustainability progress; responding vendors then provided their expertise and recommendations to help us achieve our sustainability targets, which informed our final decision-making  

We also proactively work to connect our suppliers and associates to identify opportunities to collaborate and improve our environmental sustainability For example, several suppliers presented at multiple sustainability fairs held at Humana in 2016 and 2017, allowing associates to understand how the procured services address sustainability During our Inclusion & Diversity Day, associates were encouraged to provide feedback on supplier sustainability efforts

Finally, as part of our Bold Goal initiative  an effort to improve the health of the communities we serve 20% by 2020  Humana has engaged with partners to identify social determinants of health like the environmental triggers of asthma, widely acknowledged to be exacerbated by changes in climate and reduced air quality We partner with AIR Louisville using technology, data analytics, and community collaboration to better understand the environmental triggers of asthma that afflicts almost 13% of the population in the city where we are headquartered The intention of this program is to identify the causes of asthma, which will then help our city leaders make smarter decisions about air quality The Bold Goal initiative is a notable example of how Humana responds to the intersection of environmental health and well-being

" Risk assessment flows sequentially from risk identification and is performed by executive-level risk owners and business management both, routinely, as part of day-to-day activities through ad-hoc analyses and, formally, with an annual assessment of the inherent nature of the risk, key controls and any emerging issues 

The actual level and type of risk assessment employed in each situation depends on many factors: the nature of the risk, its materiality to Chubb, the quality of the data, the underlying facts and science and, finally, potential actions post-assessment Quantification typically involves an assessment of the severity and likelihood of occurrence, analysis of Chubbs exposures (eg underwriting limits deployed, counter-party exposure) relative to risk measures (eg earnings, capital, liquidity, industry market share) and other considerations, such as collateral Specific examples of risk assessment measures utilized are accumulation and scenario These analyses may be supported by other activities including analytics, claims, actuarial, legal, investments and underwriting

Chubb is a leading proponent and user of catastrophe models to quantify natural catastrophe risk for product pricing, risk management, capital allocation and to simulate and estimate hurricane losses Chubb uses models to aggregate and closely monitor natural catastrophe exposures across its global portfolio and to ensure that its capital base is sufficiently strong to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies and policyholders and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return This information is valuable in identifying possible market opportunities, including where and how we might be able to offer coverage to consumers and businesses in areas exposed to natural perils Chubbs risk management modeling and underwriting practices are adapted to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change Since the earths climate appears to be changing in ways inconsistent with the historical record upon which catastrophe models draw data, Chubb has adopted a framework to think about how changes in short- and long-term frequency should be factored into its risk management systems Standard & Poors rated Chubbs ERM process Strong in its June 2018 ERM Rating Report, placing Chubb among the top 20% of North America and Bermuda insurers Chubb invests to continually upgrade and refine its risk management tools for catastrophes such as floods and hurricanes Chubb accounts for the potential impact of catastrophe and climate risks on the companys own facilities and operations Direct risk to Chubbs business operations exists if such weather events occur where Chubb has offices Severe weather events have tested Chubbs Business Continuity Program and operations have functioned effectively Chubbs risk analysis ranges from the known (based on definitive historical loss experience) to the hypothetical (based on a probable maximum loss (PML) calculation)

Through the use of catastrophe models, Chubb manages severe weather risk to indirect client exposures throughout the world Special emphasis is given to areas where Chubb has significant exposures and the inherent risk from extreme weather events  such as tropical cyclone and other windstorm  is deemed to be high, such as the coastal United States, Southeast Asia and UK/Europe To aid in prioritizing management focus on extreme weather events, each peril region is classified as either Tier 1, 2 or 3 according to the exposures and risk combination present Tier 1 regions are the highest priority areas for the company as they present the greatest risk profile and are the most carefully managed Tier 2 and 3 regions are also closely managed at the regional and business unit level In addition to modeled peril regions, we focus on non-modeled perils, such as flood, which present a risk in many of the developing areas of the Chubb insurance portfolio We continue to invest in developing and refining tools to identify and track our exposures related to flood, given an increasing incidence in flood losses in our property insurance portfolio over the last decade

Since the insurance products that we provide clients around the world may provide coverage for all of the risks noted, there are potential financial implications for Chubb The extent of potential negative implications depends on whether the loss is covered by the policy's terms and conditions and whether the underlying assumptions modeled in determining the pricing of the policy adequately reflect the potential risk If the model used to price coverage proves faulty or doesnt anticipate the potential magnitude of these risks in the future, then losses paid could exceed premiums collected, causing the company to draw a higher amount from its loss reserve pool that is set aside to pay future claims Conversely, if actual loss experience is lower than anticipated, positive adjustments could be made to reserve levels, producing a financial gain for the company If losses are not covered by Chubbs policies, or if the losses are within the assumptions used to price the coverage, then there would be no adverse financial implications for Chubb"	2	"Risk assessment flows sequentially from risk identification and is performed by executive-level risk owners and business management both, routinely, as part of day-to-day activities through ad-hoc analyses and, formally, with an annual assessment of the inherent nature of the risk, key controls and any emerging issues

The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) concluded in 2013 that an increase in extreme weather events, coupled with the spread of infectious diseases, and food and water scarcity, are likely to present material implications for the managed care industry through an increase in covered medical expenses SASB also noted that an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events has the potential to impact costs and liabilities by generating additional covered medical expenses and that the associated risks could lead to an increased cost of capital Higher incidence of disease could negatively affect both clinical and non-clinical staff availability, resulting in higher expenditures on sick leave and backfilling The financial implications of these health-related impacts are difficult to quantify Changes in physical climate may also affect the efficiency of our facility operations, including increased power and water consumption necessary to maintain the indoor environment of our hospitals and patient care buildings
According to the US Global Change Research Programs published 2016 scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
Current and future climate impacts expose more people in more places to public health threats Already in the United States, we have observed climate-related increases in our exposure to elevated temperatures; more frequent, severe, or longer-lasting extreme events; degraded air quality; diseases transmitted through food, water, and disease vectors (such as ticks and mosquitoes); and stresses to our mental health and well-being Almost all of these threats are expected to worsen with continued climate change Some of these health threats will occur over longer time periods, or at unprecedented times of the year; some people will be exposed to threats not previously experienced in their locations Overall, instances of potentially beneficial health impacts of climate change are limited in number and pertain to specific regions or populations For example, the reduction in cold-related deaths is projected to be smaller than the increase in heat-related deaths in most regions Every American is vulnerable to the health impacts associated with climate change Increased exposure to multiple health threats, together with changes in sensitivity and the ability to adapt to those threats, increases a persons vulnerability to climate-related health effects The impacts of climate change on human health interact with underlying health, demographic, and socioeconomic factors Through the combined influence of these factors, climate change exacerbates some existing health threats and creates new public health challenges While all Americans are at risk, some populations are disproportionately vulnerable, including those with low income, some communities of color, immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency), Indigenous peoples, children and pregnant women, older adults, vulnerable occupational groups, persons with disabilities, and persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions 
In the April 4, 2013 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, McMichael identifies three categories of climate-change risks to health, along with their causal pathway:
1	Primary: Direct biologic consequences of heat waves, extreme weather events, and temperature-enhanced levels of urban air pollutants;
2	Secondary: Risks mediated by changes in biophysically and ecologically based processes and systems, particularly food yields, water flows, infectious-disease vectors, and (for zoonotic diseases) intermediate-host ecology; and
3	Tertiary: More diffuse effects (eg, mental health problems in failing farm communities, displaced groups, disadvantaged indigenous and minority ethnic groups); consequences of tension and conflict owing to climate changerelated declines in basic resources (water, food, timber, living space)
With regard to primary risks, climate change directly impacts the populations in all geographical areas that KP serves While all regions in which KP operates are at risk of illnesses and loss of life due to extreme temperatures, the specific risk exposures may vary For example, while the Northern and Southern California regions are particularly affected by droughts, wildfires and heat waves, the Mid-Atlantic States and Georgia are more prone to severe storms and storm surges Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest are relatively more exposed to coastal flooding as well as heat waves In general, global warming can aggravate the effects of pre-existing health conditions such as chronic respiratory disease and asthma, due to increases in air pollutants and aeroallergens There is evidence of declining air quality in cities since greater heat can also worsen air pollution such as ground-level ozone or smog According to the National Center for Health Statistics, overall current asthma prevalence among adults increased from 20012002 (71%) to 20132014 (92%) By weight status, prevalence increased among overweight adults but not among adults in the obese or normal weight categories 
With regard to secondary risks, climate-related disturbances in ecological systems, such as changes in the range of infective parasites, can increase the incidence of serious infectious diseases The tick that carries Lyme Disease is reported in 457% of US counties, up from 30% in 1998  Other secondary health effects of global warming include water- and food-borne diseases Warm temperatures also increase water pollution which harms human health In rural areas, increased food insecurity can occur due to geographical shifts in optimum growing conditions and decreases in crop yields; reduced water resources for agriculture and for human consumption; and loss of property such as cropland because of floods, droughts and a rise in sea level
With regard to tertiary risks, according to The Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health: Many people exposed to the worst extreme weather events experience stress and serious mental health consequences including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and increases in suicidal thoughts and behavior Such disasters are also associated with increases in alcohol or drug abuse Children may also experience prolonged separation from their parents Beyond the well-known risks specific disasters pose to our mental health, the physical, social, and economic stresses created by climate change all increase our risk of mental health problems

"  The company actively analyzes the latest climate science to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models, and strategic planning 

i) The scope of process:

Within AIG, risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds, and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns The Enterprise Risk Management Department (ERM) supervises and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of the firms major risk positions ERM monitors all significant enterprise risks and opportunities on a regular basis, including future, potentially material risks related to climate change, such as catastrophic weather To control catastrophe exposure, AIG uses a combination of techniques, including setting key business unit limits based on an aggregate probable maximum loss, monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to supplement our other reinsurance protections

ii) How risks/opportunities are assessed at a company level:

AIGs Board of Directors oversees the management of risk through the complementary functioning of the Risk and Capital Committee and the Audit Committee and interaction with other committees of the Board Next, the Group Risk Committee (the GRC) is the senior management group charged with assessing all significant risk issues on a global basis in order to protect AIGs financial strength, optimize intrinsic value, and protect AIGs reputation among key stakeholders AIG considers climate change risk and opportunities in its investment strategies, considering companies impact on the physical environment, such as how they manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; vulnerability to climate change regulations; waste generation and management; product use impact; and environmental footprint reduction  Finally, AIG's Science team also evaluates climate change as it relates to future risk exposures with the goal of better understanding what climate science indicates about changes to the environment and develop a strategy to better anticipate changes that can influence AIGs risk profile


iii) How risks/opportunities are assessed at an asset level:
At a physical asset level, AIG does assess the risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of climate change, including individual facilities and office locations AIG has a Business Continuity plan to respond to any incident that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events The impact of Superstorm Sandy crystallized the importance of business continuity planning and the role of insurance The effect of Sandy raised awareness and heightened the perspective of such catastrophic events, particularly in the property and environmental markets

With these multiple levels of risk management processes in place and integrated across AIG, modeling and underwriting practices may continue to adapt to the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change



iv) The frequency of monitoring (in weeks/months/years):

Enterprise wide risks are evaluated and monitored at least annually at the multiple governance levels described above (ie, Group Risk Committee and the Operational Risk Committee) AIG monitors risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis to guide environmental efforts, including climate change related risks and opportunities

v) Criteria for determining materiality/priorities:
Within each business unit, senior leaders and executives approve risk-taking policies and targeted risk tolerance within the framework provided by ERM  ERM supports AIGs businesses and management in developing enterprise risk management processes for our key day-to-day operations and in identifying, assessing, quantifying, managing, and mitigating AIGs risks Accountability for the implementation of risk policies is aligned individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance with each policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit

vi) To whom are the results reported:

The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors periodically receives updates from AIGs ERM function and review the results of stress tests  Should a risk related to climate change be identified and become material, it would also be elevated through this established ERM process, with the results reported to the Board or Committee of the Board In addition, general accountability for the implementation and oversight of risk policies is aligned with individual corporate executives, with the risk committees receiving regular reports regarding compliance witheach policy to support risk governance at our corporate level as well as in each business unit"	2	"The company actively analyzes the latest climate science to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models, and strategic planning

" As our business evolves to respond to healthcare reform in the United States  through integrated healthcare delivery and operational cost reductions  we are transforming our business strategy to be more agile and responsive to current healthcare trends For example: strategically selecting and managing our changing real estate portfolio of office properties and associated services (such as data centers), expanding our number of medical clinics, and other new facility concepts are core to our success in responding to changing market demands and to the impacts of climate change We have invested staff resources and capital funds to manage risks and opportunities presented by the rising costs of fossil fuel-based energy and to improve building energy efficiency 

Addressing and collecting data on energy usage and intensity in these facilities supports our greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals We have committed that by the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 21%YOY decrease (cumulative 105%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDPs science-based target methodology, however is considered a bridge goal due to the shorter target timeframe We support our goals by collecting data on building energy efficiency and green building features when considering new spaces to purchase or lease

To this end, Humana prioritizes support given to energy and emissions reduction projects Humana initiated several large-scale lighting retrofit projects in 2016-2019 at our largest owned facilities, which are projected to reduce annual energy costs by $1,080,200 We continued to upgrade lighting in 2020 that will save an additional $82,905 per year, for a total annual savings of $1,162,295 going forward In addition, our design standards team, architect and engineering consultants, and facilities team collaborated in 2016 to develop a comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility 

We have also reduced our carbon footprint through increased efficiency of our heating and air conditioning systems and software settings that turns off personal computers when theyre not being used

Humana collaborates with internal and external partners to make joint decisions on data center projects to ensure the strategic use of funds that also provide sufficient returns in terms of energy efficiency We have worked with our equipment partners, done extensive modelling of air flow and cooling loads, and are implementing optimization strategies to minimize the cost of cooling and reduce the temperature differential required, while maintaining the reliability and performance of our data center equipment For example, our IT and Facilities Management teams collaborated to install new building management systems (BMS) at the data centers These systems provide visibility into energy efficiency opportunities such as upgrades to lithium batteries and the addition of smart tiles to enhance the BMS system by monitoring air flows not just at the cabinet level, but also at the overall level We have installed the Tridium system in the Louisville Data Center and are strategically allocating capital funds to pursue projects at the Simpsonville Data Center  As part of these efforts, in collaboration with Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions, IT, and our facilities management vendor, we have achieved Energy Star certification for both of our data centers

A team of internal and external specialists, coordinated by the Sustainability & Operations Manager, provides expertise on opportunities to reduce costs and emissions through operational efficiency and employee engagement on sustainability  In order to identify appropriate goals related to climate impact, and to track progress toward them, Humana calculates and publicly reports Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol In 2020, we undertook a more robust Scope 3 assessment to more fully evaluate our impacts along the value chain; this effort will also support our ongoing goal-setting work The company provides transparency into our goals and progress by voluntarily reporting to CDP and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), in addition to producing a publicly-available Corporate Social Responsibility report

"  Humana is committed to integrating green building principles into our existing and new portfolio of facilities with a focus on energy and water efficiency Humana advanced this objective through the integration of climate and sustainability factors such as energy efficiency projects at our facilities, access to transportation, Energy Star or LEED guidelines, employee engagement (ie, behavioral change) and other parameters, into the decision criteria used to improve our facility portfolio and select future Humana locations Opportunities for improving the portfolio and achieving energy and GHG reduction goals are identified by the Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions team in collaboration with our external consulting partners  Initiatives may be evaluated and presented to the senior management for support and funding including capital investment, employee involvement (ie, resource support) or other requirements  

Our short-term strategy is informed by our environmental goals, influencing our team to focus on energy efficient operations within our owned and leased facilities, spurring direct investment in both financial and personnel resources These investments have enabled Humana to implement initiatives to achieve our targets such as an ongoing portfolio-wide LED lighting retrofit, which will result in over $1,162,295 in annual energy savings, as well as continued alignment with our previously developed comprehensive set of design standards for office and clinical operations to ensure consistency, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices across new builds and renovations In 2020, we invested more than $300 thousand in building efficiency improvements, optimized our building occupancy rate, and implemented new energy-efficient processes and recycling standards Additional focus on infrastructure projects such as consistent BMS systems in our owned sites will create energy efficiencies We are also exploring renewable energy options to determine opportunity and feasibility toward setting a science-based target Finally, ongoing workspace optimization efforts increase workspace density while also decreasing building vacancies, thereby reducing our physical footprint and alleviating commute burden to reduce energy usage and emissions

On the whole, energy use reduction and greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts not only drive progress toward our sustainability goals, but also illustrate to our employees and customers our commitment to reduce GHG emissions and operate as efficiently as possible Employee engagement efforts include a continuing focus on increasing work from home with the understanding that this strategy will have a significant impact on Scope 3 emissions, while providing our workforce greater flexibility and reducing operational demands of our facilities

Our long-term strategy is impacted by potential consequences of climate change such as regulation, natural resource scarcity, facility operational costs and human health impacts Our Enterprise Associate and Business Solutions leaders review short- and long-term trends and impacts associated with sustainability and refine our business strategy accordingly For example, Humana's portfolio includes both owned and leased assets where many facility investments are on a long-term basis (up to 10 years) Our sustainable real estate approach ensures these investments take into consideration the long-term impacts of building characteristics on climate change and overall environmental impact, employee wellness, and operational costs
